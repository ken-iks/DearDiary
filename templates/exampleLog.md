Training Log 2024

Saturday 09/23 - 20lbs 5t x8 58m, 18lbs 5t x8 61m, 16lbs 5t x8 64m
- Honestly I’m disappointed with the distance but technically I feel like I am in a decent spot. There is obviously work to be done but overall I can not at all complain about the position we are in.
- Feeling some good range on the flat entry, I just need to keep the range and let the tension build naturally into the stand and finish. Don’t force it just let it happen

Monday 09/24 - 16lbs 5t x20 71m, 20lbs x 5 55m
- Honestly w solid day with the 16. I can’t complain at all. I was focused on trying to get some speed back with the 16, and distance was decent, but the range didn’t stay and that is not what I want overall. It’s getting there, i need to stay relaxed even whilst generating high speeds. Do anything you can to maintain that range.
- Overall a solid enough day and I’m happy to have gotten the reps in. My time will come
- With the 20 I was thinking slightly less about flat entry and more just about feeling relaxation in the winds and throughout. We will see where it takes me

Tuesday 09/25 - 18lbs 5t x16 62m 16lbs x6 68m
- Distance wise not the best day but honestly found some solid consistency and got a new cue which is to keep the left hip firm and stretch the ball around it on the entry. You can definitely feel more stretch on the entry after doing that

Thursday 09/27 - 20lbs 5t x12 18lbs 5t x 10
- honestly cannot complain. Didn’t measure but one thing I would say is that especially with the 16 I am really starting to feel myself get that tension back. TENSION IS KING AND YOU NEED RELAXED ARMS IN ORDER TO BUILD THAT TENSION.
- Still locked into that strong left hip and it’s helping a lot aswell
- See good length left on this throw with the 20. It was close but no cigar
￼

Friday 09/29 - 20lbs x20
- first 4 turn session of the winter campaign . Can’t complain. It will take time to build the proper acceleration in 4 turns to be able to properly hit that finish - especially with the 20lbs
- Overall, happy to keep keeping that left hip strong and working that range and tension. Relaxed man will always win. Flat entry with the strong left hip and then just BUILD TENSION. Let it be free. Good things will happen
- Man points session in the bag

Tuesday 10/02 - 20lbs x8, 18lbs x8, 16lbs x8
- first time doing a pyramid sessions - 4 reps each ball with 4 turns going down then 4 reps each ball with 5 turns going up
- Honestly I am happy with how we were able to maximize the session very much. I’m impressed with coach brooks as both a coach and a leader
- In terms of technique, a big help today was hitting that impulse off of the right leg whilst keeping the strong left hip and letting the ball get long. Once the impulse is done and the left hip is set, keep the left hip strong, arms relaxed, and just sit against it and turn out to enjoy the ride. Loving the consistency in technique and execution.

Thursday 10/05 - 18lbs x10 16lbs x10
- some 1 wind work that has been good for staying patient and establishing connection off 1. Still a lot of work to do on these to be able to have that impulse on the entry but then stay super long and loose and let the tension build. It will get there but I NEEEEEEEED to get that range back.

Saturday 10/07 - 20lbs x6 54m, 17lbs x6 62.80m, 6.75k x6 69.80
- Honestly some good technical insight from todays session, even though distance is still kind of disappointing me. When you HIT the impulse off of your right leg, stay with the ball through that first turn. Keep the head patient and stay with it as you flow through and turn out. Its sets you up much better to just sit and enjoy the ride
- Also, as much as heavy ball is a great training implement and a way to build a solid base for the season, today reminded me that the reason gains are to be made with the lighter balls. Much better technical insights can be taken from them. I make the specific strength gains that come from throwing the heavy ball, as those can NOT be understated, but when the time comes, I have got to be ready to launch the light balls far

Wednesday 10/11 - 16lbs x15
- first Wednesday morning session and I must say I gained a lot!!!
- When you have the impulse off of your right leg and you’re keeping that left hip strong, the next thing is… DO NOTHING
- ONCE YOUVE HIT THAT RIGHT LEG IMPULSE, LET THAT BALL RUN. LET IT RUN LET IT RUN LET IT RUN

Thursday 10/12 - 17lbs x12 65m 18lbs x8 62.50m
- it’s hard to say. I feel like I had an objectively bad session, and the distances are agreeing with that synopsis. Still some seasons bests and room for hope, but overall I simply had a bad session and I honestly don’t feel great about it. Hopefully I’ll get things together as time goes on
- Still, I am starting to understand letting it run some more. It starts to make sense how people say you should stay on two feet for longer - let the ball stretch left and only pick up your foot when you have to

Friday 10/13 - 17lbs x8, 18lbs x8, 16lbs x10
- distance noticeably low but I feel like I made some technical progress 
- Entry is coming along nicely, I just need to TURN OUT. This allows me to get better connection and progression on the throw
- This video is literally only like 62m but it LOOKS like it should go further
￼

Tuesday 10/17 - 18lbs x16 17lbs x10
- did some 1 wind 4 turn work and I definitly made some strong progress. Entry was very patient and relaxed… remember that range is everything. We can always get fast later but I’d prefer to stay long and just cover a bunch of ground on the entry (think Daniel haugh or nowiki) this sets up the throw much better
- Other than that I honestly have minimal complaints with the session - I am progressing pretty nicely 
- A nice thing I had to do today was really work the ground in the turns. This will pay dividends when we get back to 4 turns
Wednesday 10/18 - 16lbs x14 67ish 17lbs x7 63ish
- 1 wind work really paying off. A HUGE cue is to keep the left shoulder down on entry. If the ball rises as it’s stretching left then you lose so much potential radius. Stay relaxed and let it go past you by keeping that left shoulder down
- Keeping that left shoulder down sets up a really nice radius and then just stay relaxed and turn out. It gives very consistent throws. Just now stay relaxed to the end and deliver
Thursday 10/19 - 20lbs x10 55m, 18lbs x8 60m, 17lbs x7 61m
- another good session working on my cues from yesterday. Remember that once you keep that left shoulder down you got to focus on doing LESS. The movement is circular - NO UP AND DOWN MOVEMENT
- Also a very good cue on the finish is just to DO LESS. Don’t lift just let it run left. It will go up on its own. Do less do less do less. Just let that ball go where it wants
Friday 10/20 - 18lbs x12, 16lbs x12
- sleep deprived and STILL was able to get the one wind session done to a good standard
- Focus is - keep left SHOULDER down throughought. And DO LESS. Don’t lift, it’ll go up by itself. DO LESS ALL THE WAY THROUGH THE FINISH
Tuesday 10/24 - 20lbs x11, 17lbs x7
- okay the sleep deprivation hit and made this session pretty tough. Too much body movement and just generally doing too much
Wednesday 10/25 - 18lbs x8, 17lbs x10, 16lbs x4
- a much better session. Focused hard on clearing the mind. Getting in on one and then just doing nothing. Letting it run and keeping the left shoulder down
- Also a big cue today was not pulling back with the shoulders either. When you land keep letting it run
Friday 11/03 - 18lbs x5, 6.75 x7, 16lbs x7
- today was testing day and I threw 65m with the 16lbs. I’m honestly not going to read into it too much. The only thing I’ll say is that I do at some point need to start incorporating lighter balls into my training - because without that connection and speed I’m essentially just wasting my time. And I feel like whilst all this heavy ball is hopefully building up my motor, it is doing no good for 
Saturday 11/04- 20lbs x6, 18lbs x9, 17lbs x9, 16lbs x3
- much better session today. Focus was CONNECTION. The head being connected really helped with consistency and getting a good feeling

Monday 11/06 - 18lbs x5, 17lbs x5, 16lbs x10
- honestly a really good consistent session that I’m happy with. Had some very good feeling finally
- Great cues to take are: FEEL THE LEFT KNEE BEND!!! AND STAY CONNECTED THRPUGHOUGHT. THESE CUES SET UP THE RELAXED FEELING WE ARE LOOKING FOR
- KEEP THE HEAD!!! ITS A MAJOR KEY

Wednesday 11/08 - 18lbs x8, 17lbs x8, 16lbs x16
- bad session tbh. I was mainly trying to think of START FLAT STAY FLAT - LEGS CREATE THE HEIGHT. Feel like I’m on to the concept but couldn’t quite figure out the throw

Thursday 11/09 - 10kg x10 52m, 20lbs x10 54.20m
- definitly had some great feeling ands solid reps with these balls. I was disappointed with 20lbs distance but it’s actually right by my pb so something to be said for that.
- Honestly the focus was simply just connection and not doing too much. Remember that it’s a left right movement not an up down one. Stay connected and let the legs create the height.
- Also, on the entry, I like the idea of keeping the head at a point and then hitting that point just off the right foot. Helps with connection for sure
- Just keep flat and try to keep the counter good. Idk I know that I’m not where I want to be, but I am getting there. I just have to trust that process

Monday 11/13 - 10kg x5, 20lbs x8, 18lbs x8
- session in the dark so honestly it was hard to get a lot out of it, but from now until I get this feeling back, the focus is going to be SOLEY on getting the entry right and then just leaving it alone. That is all that I will think about. Get in on the entry properly, and then consciously feel yourself leaving it alone

Tuesday 11/14 - 10kg x13, 20lbs x13
- I’m definitely starting to make progress with the heavies which I’m very happy about. Building this base will certainly help with the light balls if i can get a good block of training in with the light balls
- I’m glad that coach brooks is responding well to feedback and I feel like the process of having dedicated heavy time followed by dedicated light time would do me very well. Heavies build strength, lights build connected
- TODAYS BIG THING WAS TO TURN OUT!!! I KNOW I KNOW, BEEN THERE. BUT YEAH GET IN ON THE ENTRY, THEN JUST LEAVE IT ALONE AND FOCUS ON TURNING OUT EVERY TURN!!!
￼

Thursday 11/16 - 10kg x8 52m (=PR), 20lbs x8 56.80m (PR!!!) , 18lbs 1wind x8
- TURN OUT!!!! 

Friday 11/17 - 10kg x6 50s, 20lbs x10 55.10m, 18lbs x4
- another solid day working some interesting cues
- It’s important to make sure that youre getting in on one. Obviously don’t do too much, and make sure to stay relaxed, but still you need some impulse if you don’t want it to drop
- A big thing focused on today was also patience. See outside but you have to stay patient and do rush outside. See outside clearly

Tuesday 11/21 - 16lbs x16, 7kg x8
- good session following the cues and I’m happy that work with the heavy ball was able to transfer well to the standard. Distances are still not crazy but I’m definitely happy with the technique
- Something interesting that I subconsciously thought about as the weight felt a lot lighter was having a less strong grip on the handle during my winds
- Also, more importantly, I saw an Israel video in which he stayed down really well on his entry and I was thinking about that and it helped my entry a lot.
- So I’m getting in relaxed on one, and then I’m making sure I STAY RELAXED IN THE LATER TURNS - THIS IS SO IMPORTANT FOR FEELING
- Also remember to stay disciplined and not drop your hands on the entry
￼
Friday 11/24 - 16lbs x12, 7kg x6
- okay so this was the first session with Amo of this short training camp. And I must say I have learned a lot about myself and my training style. Stuff that I don’t really need to hash out now but definitely things to consider.
- Anyways, in terms of technique - the biggest thing is to CONSCIOUSLY STRETCH LEFT. GET IN ON ONE OFF THE RIGHT FOOT AND THEN FEEL THAT STRETCH LEFT IN EVERY TURN. YOU WILL THEN ACTUALLY FEEL TENSION. STRETCHING LEFT AND RELAXED IS THE WAY TO ACTUALLY GET SEPARATION, WHICH IS WHAT SEPARATES THE GOOD FROM THE GREAT
- Just remember to stay patient and connected. Don’t chase left just stretch left. Stay disciplined and relaxed, don’t force it. SEPARATION, TENSION. DO ANYTHING TO FEEL THAT TENSION AGAIN. TENSION IS WHAT TRANSFORMED YOUR THROW
￼
￼
Saturday 11/25 - 7kg x6, 6kg x10, 12lbs x6
- The name of the game today was RANGE. I absolutley couldn’t get it together with the 7, but then was so able to hit my positions with the 6 and the 12. 
- All my lifts and movements need to be dynamic and relaxed because although I discovered yesterday that a good amount of separation is stretching left - the other BIG part of it is relaxation. Let the upper body stay relaxed and work the lower body. So today was RELAX RELAX RELAX THOSE SHOULDERS. GET IN ON AND HIT THAT ENTRY WELL, THEN STRETCH THAT BALL OUT. STAY LONG AND TURN OUT. RANGE WINS
￼
￼
Monday 11/27 - 20lbs x8, 18lbs x10, 10k 3/4 x10
- Very happy with todays session developing some very nice feels and getting deep into the throws
- Overall the biggest thing that has allowed me to get good feeling back on these reps is feeling LONG LEFT. GET IN AND FEEL AND LONG LOOSE STRETCH LEFT ON THE ENTRY. Once you set that up, you literally just stay as long and loose as possible and then just keep the rhythm
- Today gave me the feels and flashbacks of the meet in Oslo. I’m glad to have had that short training camp where I can think about tension and building a good feeling back. Length to the left is crucial, and I believe these heavy balls with get me to where I want to be as long as I keep the discipline
- Remember to focus on feeling. That is ALL that matters

Tuesday 11/28 - 18lbs x20 60.10
- this session I was consistently at about 57ish metres. It was really cold and I was slightly sleep deprived so I don’t want to make something too much of it, but I certainly do want to make improvements to my distances 
- I was still just trying to focus on getting long left and then staying long in the turns, and also trying to think about rhythm
- Distances right now are definitely scary but I am going to push hard with this ball to take it up to 70

Wednesday 11/29 - 6k 70.80, 7k 65.40
- sit, relaxed winds, length left, turn out and doing less and less with the upper body. Even relaxed jaw/ face helps. Distance are much below where I want them to be but honestly I feel like it was a solid technical session amidst a very heavy block that I cannot complain qbout

Friday 12/01 - 9k x10 58.40 PB, 8.75k x10 59.10 PB, 10k 3/4 x10
- a nice breakthrough day with the heavy balls. The technical thoughts have definitely caused some increased distances in my throws, and what’s great is that this is all whilst my knee was hurting so I couldn’t even get down on bent legs as much as I wanted to
- But anyways. Today I was trying hard to focus on SITTING DEEP, and exaggerating the stretch left on the entry. Of course done lift it, but really over exaggerate the stretch left and then stay sat down with the arms relaxed to get maximum feel of tension.
- Sitting deep definitly allowrd me to have a good consistent session today. I just need to stay on top of keeping my knee healthy

Saturday 12/02 - 18lbs x12 62.10, 16lbs x8 64.40
- Sitting is big and then another major key that was unlocked today was consciously TURNING OUT. Every throw you have to consciously make the effort to turn out. This led to some solid reps with the 18 before the 8am wake up started to hit

Monday 12/04 - 18lbs x7 62.50 (=PB), 8.5kg x7 62.20 (PB), 17lbs 1 wind x5, 16lbs 1 wind x5 65.30
- Continuing to work bent legs and relaxation which I am very happy with. Also I did this post hurdle hop session so it’s good to see the carry over of feeling explosive and seeing some stronger distances. Also the 65 1 wind with the 16 gives me good hope for the shape I’m in.
- In terms of today, I am happy to have had some focused bend in my legs and some conscious turning out and staying relaxed. Making sure to set my legs before I wind and focus on those relaxed, Igor Astapovich winds. Then feel the stretch left on entry whilst sat on bent legs, and turn out relaxed each time. Much more plyo work to be done in order to build that power base, but I am happy with todays session.
- Staying sat and relaxed is the key to speed and separation in 3 and 4. STAY DOWN. STAY OUT. DONT LET THE HEAD GO CRAZY. Today was some of the best technique I’ve had this year. Just keep trying to get on bent legs and work a bent legged position. This is major key
￼

Tuesday 12/05 - 18lbs 1 wind x12 61.30, 18lbs x14 62.30
- another 62m day with the 18 so I can’t complain. Feel like I am on the verge of getting it. Still working the same cues of feeling that stretch left on the first turn, and then CONSCIOUSLY stretching out and seeing outside every turn. This makes a big difference in patience, direction and build up. Keep relaxing and keep feeling stretch left - bigger throws are on the way
- Remember to always go back to sitting deep, stretching left, and then stretching out. These are the fundamentals. Whenever you’re trying too hard or you feel things are off, go back to these

Wednesday 12/06 - 16lbs x14 68.80 SB, 6k x10 72.20 SB
- Nice throwing today with 2 season bests and consistently my best throws of the season so far. Still working on consciously feel that stretch left on one to set of nice tension in the shoulders, then keeping that tension and stretching the ball outwards - consciously looking out every turn. Keeping relaxed in 3 and 4 is major key. Big throws are on the way 
- Remember that focusing on turning out in 3 and 4 forces you to not let your head fall back and cause disconnection 

Friday 12/08 - 8.5kg x12 61.80, 18lbs x12 64.40 PB!!!
- I’m happy to be finally getting there with the 18!! Range on 3 and 4 WHILST still turning OUT CONSCIOUSLY is majorly key. Leave the arms alone and keep going out
- Also I know I’m abit back and forth on this BUT keeping the head slightly off of the right foot with the impulse relaxed and hitting over there allows me much more time to be patient and keep turning out which is MAJOR KEY especially in 3 and 4 - work hard to keep the direction and not let the head drift. But this starts with staying disciplined and patient on the entry. Keep that head back, arms relaxed, sit and let it stretch left and out
- This video is 64.40
￼

Monday 12/12 - 7.26k x20 69.00 SB WT 35lbs x5 20.10 SB
- great session with the 16 with a new technical cue. Let the swings run left so that you can set up a long entry. The more length and patience you have on your entry the better. If you can’t feel tension off the entry, you’re doing something wrong. Once you set up the tension, just stay long, sit deep, head down and turn out, and just hold on for the ride

Sunday 12/24 - 8k x15 63.10
- Honestly not a bad first session back after some time off of throwing. Feeling the swings going left from the beginning really does set up some nice range left in the turns. Once you feel that first stretch left, stretch left AGAIN in two, then turn out out for those last two turns
- Experimenting with the flat foot landing on first turn has been interesting. It might help me be more patient in the second turn as you can see from the video I completely underturn
- Also the body felt really beat up today. Like I felt stiff and was feeling pain in the left knee and hip. After taking time off you’re definitly able to isolate the issue, and it seems to me like my left hip stuff from last year may have actually been caused by squatting. Coz I felt both the knees and the hip after that squat session
- Next one i do will be front squat, and I am going to try to incorporate more of the accessories from before so I can keep strengthening up my hips again. Honestly the pain and soreness is causing me not to be able to sit. I am not in the position that I want to be in during my throw so something has got to change
- I NEED TO START KEEPING THE HEAD IN AGAIN THO. THE THROW LOOKS TOO RAGGEDY
- Also keep it flat going into two aswell!! Don’t left the shoulders. Keep the left shoulder DOWN remember
- This throw overall is not good but look how long that entry is
￼

Thursday 12/28 - 8k x10 63.75, 9k 3/4 x10 56.10 PB
- Today was a very good session and I’m happy with it. Had to end session prematurely because of some right hamstring tightness so I need to be mindful of looking after my body and making sure I’m all right all over. I think a part of it is getting better work capacity in. And as much as I hate to admit, I think slowing down the eccentric on my squats will help with that - as will getting back on an Olympic lifting regime so my body can take the force
- Also I like the 9k 3/4 wire as a training ball. Definitely will explore that when back in America. And I have slowly weined my way off of the knee protection. I’m down to just the patellar band now and hopefully the focus on just front squat will help me to keep that train going
- In terms of the technical, I think I had a very good session working hard to feel that relaxed stretch left, and I was able to get off some good reps doing that. Pushing through / swinging through to left on the winds helps a lot with stretching left on that first time, and having that nice bend in the legs helps stay on it as the tension builds left - remember to turn left and then turn out if all else fails. Either way direction is needed
- Also there is an interesting feeling of not NEEDing to be so flat on the entry. It is okay as long as you have good bend in your legs and are really focused on stretching left and not up so that you don’t get too steep. Stretch left wins
- Also there might be some interesting response to tightening my legs on the entry. Notice how my squat was actually way stronger on the closer stance. It might be worth exploring

Saturday 12/30 - 8k x12 62.70 9k 3/4 55.90
- A very good technique session today. The thinner stance on entry is definitely something that I will keep doing
- A FUNDAMENTAL IS GETTING STRETCH LEFT IN ALL THE TURNS. FOCUS HARD ON FEELING LENGTH LEFT ON EVERY TURN CONSCIOUSLY
- Found a really nice cue of making sure to do less between 1 and 2. Once you properly set it up to be growing left on the entry, do LESS in the transition from one to two and let it stretch left again. From there keep stretching left as the speed increases. All in all very happy with the technical progress today. I think feeling good stretch left with relaxed winds will allow me to get the high levels of tension back
- This throw was the best of the session
￼

Wednesday 01/03 - 7.26kg x24 69.70 SB 10kg 3/4 x6 45.80 PB
- Some good reps today between 68-70 with the 16. Slowed down the entry to focus on just getting as long as possible and I felt it set up the throws well. The first one that’s too close up was the best of the 3 - 69.70 off the cage which is SB and promising for January
- Don’t forget relaxed winds to set up the relaxed entry. You can move the body on entry so you’re using less shoulders on entry
- THE KEY IS RANGE ON ENTRY. THINK KOKHAN. GET AS MUCH LEFT RIGHT AND THEN MORE IMPORTANTLY LEFT ON ENTRY. THIS SETS UP THE TENSION THEN JUST GO WITH IT. TURN OUT. SLOW AND LONG ON THE ENTRY. SCRAPE THE LEFT SIDE OF THE CAGE. THEN TURN OUT
￼
￼
 
Thursday 01/04 - 7.26 x20 67.60
- a solid session in absolute terrestrial rain at dartford. I’m happy to be learning well to throw in the pouring rain and improving my confidence with it. Also I’m happy to feel some consistency with the 7 again. Tbh I think it would be a good idea to go into a block of throwing more 7s for sure just so I can get to a point of throwing consistently over 70 before going back to heavy’s. 
- I’m happily working through the same cues from before - having big relaxation in my winds and then feeling the ball stretch left. It’s important to stay long and allow the orbit to grow bigger. Keep turning out and letting the arms get longer and longer. Big throws to come.
- I also think I need to have some more bend in my legs for more distance. We will see. I just need to put balls over 70 more often. It’ll get there tho.
- REMEMBER TO STAY LONG IN 3 AND 4. THATS WHAT IM THINKING ABOUT NEXT SESSION. STAY LONG IN 3 AND 4
- I can also keep my hips forward more. I think this can help

Saturday 01/06 - 7.26 x20 67.10
- Honestly for a session that felt technically very strong the distance is actually quite underwhelming - but it was a consistent session of solid throws so I will not complain about it
- Keeping the hips more forward whilst still thinking about getting that stretch left one on was a major key. And then the major key was to keep consciously stretching left in 2 3 and 4 aswell. Be conscious about letting the ball run long and left. Make sure to let the orbit grow and grow and grow. 
- I again think more distance can come from more bent legs. I just feel like there is more force that can be applied to the ball than currently is being done. Part of that may also come from needed to do more power movements in the gym aswell

Tuesday 01/09 - 7.26 x30 68.20, WT 45lbs x5, 35lbs x3
- deep session in the snow today after already having done some reactive hang snatch
- Happy with the distance considering the conditions. Found consistent length left but struggled with the debate of turning out vs stretching left
- Thought about covering as much ground as possible on the entry. All the way through to 180.
- One new thing that I feel really has potential to be great is me keeping two feet on the ground for as long as possible. The throw feels simple and long which I like - I just have to keep the range but make it move a little more. It’s about keeping length left and allowing the hall the stretch out. It will come
- Get more length left in winds??

Wednesday 01/10 - 7.26 x14 66.70, 6k x8 70.40 WT 45lbs x5, 35lbs x5
- much worse distances than the feeling suggested, but this means that there were some learnings to take away
- In a positive, I felt the most range and building of tension that I had ever felt so far this year. This was due to me keeping two feet on the ground for as long as possible whilst keeping my arms SUPER LOOSE AND RELAXED in the winds and all the way through one. 
- The problem lies in the age old debate of stretch left vs out. It seems that in the end, stretching left wins the battle. My turning just out is making me not have separation, which causes pretty throws with no distances (and the kind of throws that brooks likes lol)
- So whilst the distances weren’t good today, I learnt a big lessons whilst unlocking another key to the puzzle: I know a breakthrough is coming soon
- Weight throw went much better carrying out the long relaxation and long push left from my hammer. Having big relaxation and patience (do nothing with the arms - slow and relaxed left) in the entry definitly helped produce some bigger throws. Overall a great days work which I am very happy with

Thursday 01/11 - 7.26 x20 67.50, WT 45lbs x5 18.10 SB, 35lbs x10 21.70 SB
- I am honestly very pleased with how camp is found going so gar. I started today with a headache and generally thought I wouldn’t be able to get after it today. But I was able to find some solid form and I am certain distance will follow as time goes on. I’m excited to continue this 7.26 camp until I work back with the 8 once j term is over
- Technically, the main insight is actually having a right side on entry. It’s crazy but you need to have a relaxed right side to make sure you have time to stay patient and get left. Like exaggerate it. As long as you’re relaxed and actually have time to get left, it’s ultra ultra long and WILL produce big throws. Trust the process. I really feel like the pieces are coming together
- With the weight session, I think there is definitely some big positives to take away - I carried over the right side to left side patient entry very well from hammer to weight, and I think I worked the ground pretty nicely. With the weight the number one killer is steepness. You have to keep the plane flat if you want to survive. So you need extreme relaxation and patient to just let it be flat and left from one to four. Big throws are on the way
￼

Friday 01/12 - 7.26k x24 67.10, 9k 1/2 45.30 SB
- okay I’ll admit, there is a little frustration in getting stuck at 67m training. The consistency is there, but it is honestly just not flying the distances that it needs to fly
- That said, today there was some promising development. The knees have got better and I am now able to turn on bent legs again. This caused like 4 throws in a row all at 67 -  ones that didn’t even feel that good
- I kept the head back on one and felt the long push of the legs on the ground. Also focused on exaggerating the stretch left on the entry. I think I need to keep exaggerating that stretch in the rest of the turns aswell. I may be losing it.
- I also think even if I’m not going to connect through the turns, I think I really really need to connect on one. I’m just thinking back to those good technical throws with the 17 from last year. I think if I can get connected on one, with the bent legs and the long exaggerated stretch left, I am reaching territory I haven’t reached before
- Also I changed my grip to 3 fingers on 3 fingers

THIS IS TO REMIND YOU OF A FLAT AND CONNECTED ENTRY, BECAUSE EVIDENTLY I HAVE FORGOTTEN WHAT IT TAKES. DONT LET THINGS GET TOO STEEP. STAY FLAT STAY LEFT STAY CONNECTED. I know I need a flatter entry. Don’t let things get steep

Saturday 01/13 - 8k x14 61.50, 7.26 x10 67.00
- back to basics today, and I really don’t mind it. Big sit, big relaxation, keep the head left on entry to connect. Then just stretch left in each turn. Consciously try to get your leg down when out left. Distance isn’t here but having conscious sit 100% allows the orbit to stretch more left in 3 and 4.
- a good way to keep that flat entry is to hit zero on the entry. This keeps me both connected and flat. Look at my entry from NCAAs
￼

Monday 01/15 - 7.26k x22 67.90, 9k 1/2 x8 49.10 PB
- tried to flatten my entry by hitting zero and letting it be flat and left. I was simply focused on sitting on bent legs and getting in on one to hit zero flat. The only problem with this is that I didn’t find any range and tension that I’m looking for, because my entry was flat but it wasn’t long. I need to relaxed in the winds and trust that range wins. Overall tho, I was trying to work a flat entry, and that happened. I’m honestly feeling discouraged, but Rome wasn’t built in a day, so I simply just have to keep pushing.
- I know I was also thinking about the whole going left and getting down when I’m left thing, but I don’t know how long term a solution that is - perhaps this is causing all my dragging that turning out doesn’t cause. I know turning out works so maybe I need to get back to that

Tuesday 01/16 - WT 35lbs x15
- A lighter throws days. Tried to just focus on staying flat and not letting it get too steep. And then keeping the head connected. This will give me a greater feeling of length. I just think I need to get my arms straight from earlier and let it run longer. Maybe hitting the entry harder will help. Also I think connection in 3 and 4 would be a good help for me. Like connection WITH separation will just mean EXTREME TENSION.
- I was also thinking of turning out instead of turning left. Distance is all that matters at the end of the day
- The head is going to be crucial to me feeling tension in 3 and 4. If I lose my head then I am losing important radius that I can’t afford to lose. Notice my head at catch 3 and 4 (especially 3 - great catch) for my 73m throw in Norway vs my head in 3 and 4 on a 67m training throw. Once I line things up again it’s game time
￼

￼

Wednesday 01/17 - 18lbs x16 NET
- An honestly decent session today. I had to take a step back to take one forward but I am being one with the ball and it is making the throw flow much better. I can feel good flat orbit and I feel like the throw is moving well. To accompany this and ensure that I stay connected in 3 and 4, I have felt myself trying to push with my right arm throughought the throw in an effort not to drop my left shoulder. I am not sure how successful this will be in terms of distance or really feeling tension, but we shall see
- If this proves beneficial it might be worth doing some right arm turns to feel that push
- Also I need to get to the point where I can do this on bent legs. FR
- Being one with the ball means lock in with the HAMMER. Not the wire, the BALL. Do this whilst turning out on bent legs and we’re cooking for sure
￼
*also got 365 front squat today for 3 which means I AM getting stronger. Yay for me

Thursday 01/18 - 15lbs x20, 10k 3/4 x5, 45lbs WT x10
- great session today in the snow. Really found some good connection. Catching my head on the ball at zero and keeping my head on the ball. It was focused on FLAT, LONG, AND HEAD ON THE BALL. It was relatively low intensity throws, but keeping the head on the ball forces things to stay flat and long. Tension builds and the hammer has a very nice orbit. Overall a good session and I’m happy with it. Technique is getting closer!!!! Flat. Head on ball. Once you connect on the entry, just stay on it. Don’t try and do any more.
￼** I just want to double down that we are BACK IN BUSINESS!!!
- also had a great session with the weight. Same things as the hammer, but just had to be intentional about being flat on that entry and staying on it. If you start pulling you WILL lose your low point
￼

Friday 01/19 - 7.26k x20
- another great session picking up from where I left off yesterday. New development is keeping the hip forward and connecting with my head slightly to the right of zero. No matter what, CONNECTION IS EVERYTHING. Lock that connection in on one and then just stay with the hammer for the ride. I’m very happy with the technical developments and hope to keep the ball rolling as we head into j term
- HEAD ON THE BALL AT ALLLLLL TIMES
- Hips forward, relaxed arms, head on the ball
￼
￼

MEET day 1 01/19 : 21.12m
- This was a bad meet in general. Feel pretty disappointed with the way in which I competed, but it is just a learning experience. I ripped off the entry and in general just didn’t trust that range wins the battle. Speed is 100% not everything. Get connected and then DONT FORCE ACCELERATION. Range holds up in the meet, speed doesn’t. Keep connected and long. Patient on the entry and then get more and more patient and the throw goes on. 3 and 4 you HAVE to stay disciplined. Let the throw build don’t just just hold it flat. Flat is important. Patient and length is everything. Speed works itself out. Believe in range. Believe in connection believe in patience. I know this is not the start we wanted, but it’s the start we needed. Time to learn from it and get better
- R6 had potential and for that I feel a little better. You just need to keep the head connected in 3 and 4. Don’t try to rip for speed. Put good bend in your legs so that they can help you get out of trouble, and then just make sure to keep the head connected and the shoulders flat. If you pull your head, your shoulder axis goes off which puts the ball in a bad position which makes it hard to release. Even on r6 you did this. You MUST keep the head in 3 and 4. Take what you have, don’t try to rip for speed. Range wins. Legs give speed. 

Tuesday 01/23 - A: 8k x14, 9k x7 B: 6.8k x14, 7.7k x7
A:
- Not so good of a first session back with the heavy balls. I really believe in the flat entry and find it hard to find with the heavies - but I just need to keep working at it
- Also the feeling of range and a building of tension is NEEDED. I need to find a way to get it back. Need to explore options to get my head back connected from the start to the finish of the throw. 
- Also I think my depth still needs work. So I need to do what I can to get back to some good depth. 
- Head connected, arms relaxed (feel the stretch), and work the ground.
- Let the entry run. Don’t lift at all on the entry. Just enter and let it go. Now lift on the entry. Just think about left and right. Keep the head connected and keep it running. Maybe keep chin tucked in? Maybe keep head looking at right elbow
- Don’t lift at all. Keep relaxed and keep left to right. That’s all!!!!!
B:
- a great session up come back from a session that was less good. Changed up the start to allow for a better grip again on the handle (3 left fingers, 4 right fingers, on the far side of the handle so right pinky is not on edge). Was able to get a far better feel on the hammer and was able to connect really well off the entry and get moving
- Also really enjoyed turn 3 and 4. Thought hard about grinding turn 3 and 4. Big pushes in 3 and 4 to accelerate the ball and gain speed. Once I get that under control with good range and connection, it’s UPP. Keep working kid

Wednesday 01/24 - A: 7.26k x16 71.40 SB!!! , 8k x8 B: 35lbs WT x10
- BIG DAY! Finally back over 70. Nice long flat entry with relaxed arms, and then grind out that right leg in every turn. While grinding out the right leg, the most key thing GET CONNECTED AND STAY CONNECTED IN 3 AND 4. This is CRUCIAL. Connection in 3 and 4 is so important. You have to hold you neck strong to be able to overcome the g force making your head go up. Be strong and keep the head connected in 3 and 4. Big throws are on the way
- Videos are both over 70
￼
￼
- with the weight - LESS IS MORE. Ultra relaxed and easy on the entry. Just be patient in one and two and let it run. Then even in 3 and 4 you don’t need to go crazy. Grind the legs but keep it long. Length is everything. If things are going wrong - slow down and more relaxation on the entry should fix things up

Thursday 01/25 - A: 9k x7 55.10, 8.5k x7 56.10, 8k x7
A:
- better feelings in this heavy session than I had in last weeks heavy session for sure. By the last set I was pretty cooked but basically was just trying to stick with focusing on keeping that head still with the ball in 3 and 4. Had to sit deeper with these balls - partially because my knee was playing up and partially for better feeling. Over felt like a solid day. No real technical breakthroughs just more work put in
- This last throw with the 9k which was around 55 shows that I’m lifting the ball which is causing the low point to drift. Even though it’s heavy I must resist the urge to pull the ball out of its natural orbit
￼

Friday 01/25 - 35lbs WT x12 22.10
- had a good premeet getting ready for my competition tomorrow. The main thing to focus on NOT to turn the gas on in 3 and 4. The only thing that matters in the weight is range and flat. Keep the arms relaxed in 3 and 4. Not even a super slow start to acceleration - literally just keep long in the turns. Also remember to do even less in the meet then you were doing today. RELAXED MAN WINS. STAY LONG IN 3 and 4. KEEP IT FLAT AND KEEP IT LONG. KEEP HEAD ON IT AND LET THE LENGTH GET LONGER AND LONGER. Best of luck tomorrow
- Lift also went really well. Recorded a new best in the front squat 395x2 and did 275 power clean for 2 which puts me back up to where I was at last year at best. I’m also happy because I had the super long and relaxed arms and shoulders in the clean even when it got heavy, and I kept super good posture in the front squat as it got heavy. These are lessons!! Relaxed man wins. Focus on form and things take care of themselves.

MEET DAY 2 01/26 : 21.74m
- much better today. I am happy with how I handled the meet from start to finish. I made the right technical adjustment in round 6 and was able to really find one. Technically, I HAVE TO HIT THAT ENTRY FLAR. FLATTER THAN I EVEN THINK. SUPER FLAT ENTRY SETS THE THROW UP SO MUCH BETTER IN THE WEIGHT. FEEL LIKE YOURE AT SHOULDER HEIGHT.
- Then just KEEP YOUR HEAD ON THE BALL - SAME AS HAMMER. BE DISCIPLINED AND LET IT BUILD.
- In terms of next steps, we now just need to hit that entry hard to set up big length left on that entry. You can move a lot better than you’re moving for sure - but this is a solid set up!
￼

Monday 01/29 - 17lbs x5 66.90 SB, 15lbs x16 71.50 SB, 6k x3 75.30 SB
- complete day of SBs which is very interesting to me since it honestly didn’t feel like the craziest day. 
- I worked on more bent legs are really feeling length on my entry by hitting it away from me on the entry. Was able to find some nice throws by swinging more back and allowing my right side length to translate to good tension on zero. Length is everything. It’s not there yet but it’s getting closer
- Also grind out the legs. The legs and range give you speed. Once the head locks in, you just turn out and keep the head locked in. Turning out gives you separation which is key. Stay patient, and then when it’s time to go, we go - and we build this orbit

Tuesday 01/30 - A: 18lbs 1 wind x20 NET, B: 15lbs x20 69m, 17lbs x10 61m
A:
- got some solid work done into the net focusing on grinding at the legs and working the ground. Also I was able to find some good reps with keeping the head back on entry and hitting the impulse a little bit lower and kind of Igor Astapkovich -esce. They were solid reps feeling the ball go past me.
- Also, a big thing I did today which came from yesterdays session was pushing the ball to 180. Pushing past on the entry and then consciously turning out in every turn. It’s been helping a lot!!! You can actually find some legs and speed when you consciously turn out. I think this is the next big thing (I know I’ve already had it - but now I have it with better legs)
- Remember that British champs is also a slow circle. These sessions are important because you really do need to learn grind out those legs. Push to 180 with a big right side grind. Put out the cigarettes, right the skateboard. Whatever you need
￼
B: 
- so it seems that the learnings from this morning didn’t fully translate to the outside unfortunately. Nonetheless I was able to find some STRETCH OUT. This made me have some good feelings, and so can’t be dismissed. I feel that I just didn’t have the legs to have good speed today in 3 and 4. I say keep working this entry. I think it has potential. Just remember that steepness kills. Also the last couple days I have been doing some foot fouling. I think I need to get back to keeping that stronger hip maybe?
￼
I think this hip position on 1 is bad and causing me to have a bad second turn. Strong hip should fix this

Thursday 02/01 - 15lbs x24 67m
- the distance doesn’t do justice to how good this session felt from a technical perspective. Main takeaways were the flat cam rogers entry (I just think I may need to do that with better posture). But like an entry that is literally flat like perfectly flat and round with no lift. Like flatter than you’d even think was appropriate. Then with that flat entry, staying down on 3 and 4 (like keeping the left leg bent) was very helpful. Obviously I am not where I want to be yet but I have made strides and the distance will follow once the movement is right. Keep it flat and long. Get the feeling of good movement and good range. You have the range in the winds - take it into the flat first turn then just keep building out. Don’t force the head, keep connected by focusing on rhythm and allowing the movement to come to you

Friday 02/02 - 16lbs x21 
- solid session pushing the speed back up. Distances are nothing but my movement is getting better. An interesting takeaway that I got from my 275x2 clean and my 400x3 front squat is that strong posture (in terms of spine / proud chest - not necessarily hips forward) is strong. This will help employ the flat entry, which I think is going well - and really helps me stay in the circle wayyyy more consistently, which was becoming a little problem recently. Also this would help me in the weight which is great aswell. It’s tough that the distance isn’t here yet but I know it will come, I just have to stay patient and keep believing
- I also switched back away from the static start just so I can get some more intensity in the winds. I still haven’t found that round yet that I’m looking for but I think that setting up a good speed and orbit will  help me find it

Monday 02/05 - WT 35lbs x10, 32lbs x4 22+
- First… finally hit 4 plates on front squat. FOR 3!!!
- And weight throw session was also good. Finding some consistency in the high 21 with the 35 and finally able to get 22+ two throws in a row
- The technical piece is: posture, connect on a flat and AWAY entry, then turn out. That’s it!!! Hit it flat and away from you, with that head connected, then just stay relaxed and turn out. Keep it simple and let’s run it up. This is your time kid. Keep stacking the days and big things will come. You’ve gotta believe
- Another way to word it: beat it away from you on the entry. The harder you beat it the more speed / length left you’ll have

Tuesday 02/06 - 17lbs x10 63.50, 15lbs x20 69.40
- Great money in the bank today the day after heavy squats.
- I found a huge entry by trying to exaggerate the size of the circles on my swing, and then get a flat and long push on that entry that’s connected so I can get a big first turn - I want to maximize the size of the circle on my first turn. Then from there keep being reactive, turning out and trying to push the rhythm. Think hard to push the rhythm and gain speed. Be active turning out.
- Good high volume session where I made gains and had consistency throughout
- I also thought about pushing the woosh on entry - which was a balance between hitting it out away from me and hitting it flat and across me so it can get out left. Haven’t fully figured that out yet but that is where I can add speed to my long entry. Then we’re cooking

Wednesday 02/07 - WT 35lbs x12, 32lbs x6 22.50+
- message of the day today is FALL ASLEEP AT THE WHEEL. Nothing matter more than having range in 3 and 4. Hit it out to the right side and then have a LONGGGG entry (big circle around you like in the hammer) - and then keep relaxed in 3 and 4. It is ultra important that you fall asleep at the wheel in 3 and 4. Stay relaxed and sleeeeeeeep. 3 and 4 relaxation is key. Fall asleep at the wheel and keep turning out. The weight is a great opportunity to learn relaxation that can carry to the hammer - coz you get immediate feedback to your relaxation.
- Wide base at the start and get a bigggg circle on the entry. Then just stay longggg
￼

Thursday 02/08 - A: 17lbs x12 63.80, 15lbs x10 71.90 SB, 6k x8 76.70 SB B: 35lbs WT x4 pre meet
- today was a great session and made some very nice technical breakthroughs with the balls.
- How I would describe this session is: GROWTH TO 180. Like yesterday, you have to be fearless and allow the orbit to grow by keeping the arms relaxed. A great way to set that up is to have the low point off that right foot and get out to that high point at 180. Then just keep letting that orbit grow out out 180 and keep pushing the rhythm. Big throws are on the horizon
￼ 
B:
- also had a great premeet working the same cues as the morning. Now it’s time to forget about it and focus on execution. Stay relaxed and BUILD TO 180. Don’t rush it - let the orbit build to 180 and it WILL fly. Stay relaxed and trust the work

MEET DAY 3 02/09 : 22.89m
￼
- so much better today. Although I can still push the speed, I am glad that I executed after not having the best start to the competition. Main takeaways are that I need to:
- Put more stick on the glove so that I don’t release early (plus put the stick on earlier so it has more time to set).
- Be patient and build to 180 - don’t cut the turns short. Trust it and let it build to 180 - LET IT GROW LET IT GROW LET IT GROW
- Take on the entry on that right side. Be patient and hit it hard on the right side. Don’t rush it - take it on on the right side and stay relaxed and let it build to 180. Big throws to come
- DONT BE AFRAID TO TAKE IT ON ON THAT RIGHT SIDE. As long as you don’t rush it it’s money every time
- Mental piece: keep the relaxation. Forget about pre meets, forget about the past. Keep relaxation, keep smiling, keep humming and singing your songs and staying relaxed. Remember to compete at a 3. Dont hype, just chill, smile and be relaxed. You know what is coming

Saturday 02/10 - 10k 3/4 x12 46.90 PB, 17lbs x12 64.60
- solid day with both balls after a long day at the meet. Cannot complain at all based on how I felt coming into the session. Main takeaways are to keep making sure I keep my winds very big. This helps smooth out and keep my arms relaxed on my entry even as I’m trying to make sure I find one. Then just keep building out to 180 nicely. Smooth to 180 - and don’t lift on the entry - just LET IT BUILD
- Make sure to find 180. Not close to 180 - 180!
- This throw had great feelings
￼
￼

Monday 02/12 - 10k 3/4 x10 48.00 PB, 17lbs x10 65.20, 15lbs x10 71.00
- a good session today moving on up with the short 10k. I know 50m is coming soon. Honestly I like this cry cycle. The 30 rep sessions are hard work but the rewards will be reaped eventually. For now, I am glad to be moving on up with the 17 and pushing out solid marks with the 15 too.
- In terms of the technical, I found some good execution today of letting the orbit build gradually in the throw. Relaxation on the entry and not letting it get too steep too early. Build to 180 GRADUALLY. Let the orbit get bigger in each turn, don’t just go straight from small to big. Find 180 each time and keep letting the orbit get bigger and bigger. Big throws are on the way.
- Also I was able to put some good speed on the 17 which is good. You can actually attack the throw and build it into something good.
￼
￼

Tuesday 02/13 - WT 35lbs x10, 32lbs x5
- Had a rough start with some inconsistencies and fouling (a lot of fouling with the 35) but I wrapped up decently with the 32 - with like 4/5 reps in a row well over 22 and possibly into the 23s. I’m still looking for more but with a rough ish day so far I’ll just take it on the chin and move on
- You have to be relaxed on entry (DONT FORCE IT) if you want consistency. Then build to 180 the same way you know how. Work the ground well to have big acceleration and big growth in 3 and 4, and it’ll come.
- Had a very close quality sleep somehow. I think I just worked too late into the night and then didn’t have any form of relaxation going into the night. Also my lack of caffeine in the day didn’t help at all

Wednesday 02/14 - WT 35lbs x25
- started to find some consistency over 22 with the 35 and also having far less sector fouling which is good. Hitting it out and right on entry is a big must as well as being relaxed, down on your legs, and consciously building to 180. Remember that you don’t want to be too steep on that entry. Consciously build out to 180 and let it flow and build naturally - but at the same time make sure it actually builds, building in 3 and 4 is the most important.
- In terms of consistency, staying down on the legs was a big help. It gave consistency in both the sector and the circle too
- Towards the end of the session I started playing with having a big push 1 to 2 in order to not lose the low point, and have my rhythm be split up into 1 and 2 vs 3 and 4. It work well in terms of ball position but was hard to stay connected, I felt myself both dragging and not having the orbit build like I would like it to. Still, distance is solid, and so was that consistency that proves to me that hitting on that right side, and building to 180 (consciously building to 180 each turn) will produce 22+m throws. So at least I can have confidence in that
- Also on another note since the money ball is more similar to a hammer plus is the ball I’ll be competing with, it probably is for the best that I train with it more
- I’ve just got to do something to fix the transition from 1 to 2. Once I do that, it’s game time. Maybe it’s worth exploring that flat foot catch with the building to 180

Thursday 02/15 - A: 17lbs x12, 15lbs x14 B: 6k x20 76.80 SB
A:
- had a good session today in the freezing cold. Probably some of the worst conditions I have thrown in and was able to find some good consistency which I’m happy with. Consistent low 60 for the 17 and hit a good number of throws over 70 with the 15.
- I feel like the flat foot landing did give me some good stability and helped with the consistency so I will keep pushing with that. Also I thought about hitting that impulse earlier (swinging more back). Do this and build to 180 (make sure to build in 3 and 4) gave me some good results. I think if I keep my hips more forward when I do this swinging back it will allow it to not get too steep
B:
- Best session I have ever had with the 6k. Had 2 measured at 76.80 and multiple over 75 (maybe like 10 at that distance). So overall a great session
- On the technical side, the main focus was following up on collecting that hammer on the right side (swinging back) and then being patient and long on that first turn to 180. Make sure it builds on that first turn not too too flat. And then from there hit the ground hard and react for a big transition from toe turn to heel turn - the orbit should continue to build into big throws. It all starts with that long and patient entry (relaxed arms - push all the way through long to 180) and then work that ground to find super high speeds. We are getting there!!

Friday 02/16 - WT 32lbs x20 23+
- great and consistent session today with the 32. I’m happy to be consistently over 23 and also consistent hitting good throws. Happy that things are coming together at the right time. Blessed
- Technically, I focused on: having a strong counter on my entry so that I can land one strong and work the ground better going from one to two. Having RELAXATION on the entry (don’t care if it drops a bit) and being PATIENT on that entry - be patient and gather from that right side, and then follow that hammer round long with a strong counter on the entry to 180. From there, keep countering, work the ground hard, and build to 180. The big throws are coming
- Here is a video around 23m. Look at that great catch position in one
￼

Monday 02/19 - A: 10k 3/4 x12 50.00 (PB!), 17lbs x12 66+ B: 35lbs x5
A:
- Overall a great and consistent session - all whilst feeling sick (coming down with a cold) but I worked some nice cues that gave me both good consistency and solid distances
- Today I worked on hitting zero and countering well at zero (think lance deal) and then staying on two feet for a long time and letting the ball build and take you round. Time in double support is a major key for feeling that range. Just remember to keep countering and let it building. 
- Also remember to keep the winds big. Far back behind your head and good relaxation in the shoulders. Hit zero and be patient and let the ball take you. Keep countering and keeping letting the orbit build out to 180
B:
- honesty a bad session in the weight but I just feel like whilst being sick it’s hard to have a weight session right after a taxing hammer session so I won’t read into it too much. Hopefully I can start feeling better tomorrow and get some better reps in

Tuesday 02/20 - WT 35lbs x10 23.50+ (PB!!!!) 32lbs x7 24+ (PB!!!!)
- Best and most consistent session I’ve had. Competition mindset for the reps helped me to have some meet simulation reps. And I was reward with like every throw above 22
- Main focus today: counter (sit and posture - can’t have one of the other must be both), and keep that longgggg double support. Let the hammer take you round. Then just turn out to 180 let it build and boom big throws are coming
- A great confidence booster plus I finally got 225 snatch so overall a great effort and a great day of training
- These videos are both 22.50+ and they were even good reps. But look at the long double support
￼

Wednesday 02/21 - WT 35lbs x15 23ish
- a decent session with a good number of throws comfortably over the 22.30 line so I can’t complain. Feeling a little sicker than I felt yesterday in the session - not so sure why, but I think best bet is to have that worst case scenario redbull at the meet
- Technically, I was sure to keep working those cues I was working yesterday. Good counter by bending the legs and keeping the chest up strong/ hips forward. Feel that right foot drilled into the ground such that the ball goes past you and takes YOU round. Then just stay relaxed and keep building to 180. Big sit and counter is good, relaxation and letting it run left it good. Big throws to come.
￼

Thursday 02/22 - 16lbs x18 70.90 SB, 6k x10 76.90 SB
- solid session with distances moving in the right direction. Annoyingly still feel there is so much more there but it’s coming and I’m ready for it.
- In terms of cues, I though again about sitting against the ball and countering well. Having a patient entry keeping that right foot drilled into the ground until it HAS to come off. Keep it on the ground for as long as humanly possible. Longer than you even think you should.
- Also I thought with the 6k about not getting so steep on the entry. Keeping flatter on the entry and then letting it build. Good consistency and good work in the bank

Friday 02/23 - WT 35lbs x5 pre meet 
- took a couple of easy throws at 22, then took a comp intensity throw at 22.50ish
- This is solid - I like how I can have that separation between easy throws and comp intensity throws. I’m happy with the relaxation and the correction, and with being ready to save my big throws for meet day
- Technically, sit back and against the ball, hit that entry out relaxed and keep the right leg down LONGER THAN YOU THINK. Let the ball force your right leg off the ground. Then just turn out to 180 and let it build. Big throws are coming. Keeping that right down and being patient and waiting for it to take you is a major key.

MEET DAY 4 02/24 : 24.39m NR AND NCAA LEAD!!!
￼
- great day, great series, great focus. I am happy that I set myself up exactly as my process goes and it has proven to work again!! 
- SIT, TRUST THE COUNTER, BE PATIENT WITH THAT RIGHT FOOT DOWN AND LET THAT BALL RUN PAST YOU, THEN JUST STAY DOWN AND BUILD TO 180. 
- I’m happy with the mental approach to the competition and believe that I am 100% capable of winning nationals. I need to keep focus and not overthink. Stay relaxed, stay chilled, stay locked in. Bigger throws to come
- With a strong sit and counter (BIG COUNTER) the throws are consistent and safe. Trust your process. Don’t go east on round 1. Trust your process and build to big throws

Monday 02/26 - 7.26k x30 72.60 PB!!
- My first full training pb of the year! I’m happy with this after having some pretty weight throw heavy times and honestly not really being ‘on it’ aswell. Also some great consistency so we are in good position for sure
- Biggest thing was letting that ball BUILD past me. So keep that right foot grounded and let it run past you, but let it GROW past you. Don’t hold it down let it build to 180. THEN CONSCIOUSLY GET OUT TO 180 EVERY SINGLE TURN. This is major key. Happy with the throws today and I’m excited for bigger throws to come this season

Tuesday 02/27 - A: 6k x20 78.30 PB!!! B: 35lbs WT x12
A:
- keeping the pb train rolling with a big effort today
- Technically, there were some good lessons. If you want the acceleration and rhythm to build nicely you have to let the orbit BUILD to 180. If you keep letting it build and build in the later turns then the acceleration is great. 
- Also, YOU CAN have that low point at zero IF you’re RELAXED on entry. If you have relaxed winds, zero low point, and keep that right foot grounded for an uncomfortably long time, then you’re set up to just build out nicely to 180 and big throws are coming.
- Never lose sight of the fact that the counter is the thing that starts everything off in terms of growth
B:
- lackEd some energy coming off of the hammer session so the weight didn’t go so well but I’m not gonna over think it. Trust your counter, let it run past you and keep that right foot grounded uncomfortably long. Then just keep letting that ball build to 180. Big throws to come

Wednesday 02/28 - WT 35lbs x10 30lbs x10
- Some consistent 22+ with the 35 but really not much consistency beyond that and wasn’t really finding my entry the way I wanted in terms of the counter and the stretch left. 
- Finally found some strong technique with the 30lbs which resulted in good and consistent throws above 25m which is a great place to be in.
- Technically, a key piece is to trust that counter on entry. Really feel yourself leaning back and setting up a strong counter on the entry
- Also a major key is to really really get that ball to zero. As you know, the majorest key is to have that super long double support and really let that ball stretch past you, and that is at its easiest when you consciously let that hit that ball at zero and then let it take you round. Even if it builds round you, you have a great long set up left with a strong counter
- Then the last key is turn TURN TO 180. Really consciously make the effort to see 180 each turn. Big big throws are on the way
- i still can be more patient and keep that right leg drilled into the ground for EVEN LONGER on that entry. Trust it. And TRUST THE COUNTER, REALLY LEAN BACK AND SIT AGAINST THAT BALL. TRUST IT
- Also trust the competition entry. With a good counter, you really can hit it and zero and keep that right side rounded so the ball can run past you left
- Allowing that entry to be a little flatter seems to encourage more length left on that entry too

Thursday 02/29 - 7.26k x18, 6k x6
- a rough morning session in some harsh winds so I’m not going to over think it. Just felt like I couldn’t really figure out my entry - but whilst the focus for this next week is making sure that the weight throw is looking strong, I’m okay with this. No throws tomorrow and then a day off Sunday aswell should have me feeling fresh going into the week and ready to hit some huge throws at nationals

Saturday 03/02 - 35lbs x10 24ish, 30lbs x5 26ish
- a great session really putting them out there consistently which is very important around this time. Keeping the fundamentals strong has been very great
- Keeping a strong counter will stop all fouls because you are strong enough against the ball to let it go in 4. So, keep a STRONG counter (TRUST IT), and then let that ball run past you and don’t take your right foot off until the ball takes it off. Feel it go as far past you as it can before that right foot comes off the ground. With that strong counter and length left - KEEP THE SHOULDERS RELAXED. Radius makes such a big difference. When relaxing the upper body tho, it’s easy to drop your counter a bit on the entry, and that will screw you. Trust that you can take the ball on with intensity and keep that right foot drilled into the ground forever. Then just keep those shoulders relaxed, keep the counter strong, and turn out to 180. Big throws are coming
￼
￼

Monday 03/04 - WT 35lbs x10 23.50+, WT 30lbs x5 25.50+
- Probably my most consistent practice I’ve had which is a great feeling. Back was starting to tighten up late in the sesh so I’m glad to have taken my final full weight throw practice. I think the back is starting to heal up a bit so let’s hope it keeps making progress
- In terms of technique, I’m very happy to have just continued to keep drilling in the fundamentals. Big counter and trust it, trust that you can hit zero and keep that right leg grounded and let the ball run past you as far as it possibly can. Then just stay relaxed and keep turning out to 180. TRUST THE COUNTER. TRUST THE ENTRY. YOUVE GOT THIS. You know the drill. Save the big one for the meet. Stay dialled in, stay focused, trust God and trust the process!

Tuesday 03/05 - 7.26k x10 74.50 BIG PB, 6k x8 79.20 PB, 9k 1/2 x6 48.10
- Best hammer session I have ever had. PBS with 2 very important balls that remind me that firstly the indoor peak has worked and secondly there are certainly big throws to come. With these new forces on the body recovery is as important as ever!
- Technically, today I had a nice strike on the entry. Hitting it at zero like a golf ball and then letting it build out and past me drilling that right leg into the ground and letting it stretch past me. With a good counter (good sit against it), you can then just building out and keep letting that orbit grow bigger and bigger. For now I actually don’t mind the steepness 
- As it’s running past you - make sure not to short it. Let it run and grow left before taking your right off the ground then just turn out and GO🫡
- Interestingly the best session of my life was followed by a subpar lift lol - but the jumps were moving well so all good
￼
￼

Wednesday 05/06 - WT 35lbs x5 pre meet
- feeling good. Remember to have courage. Trust the work. Trust the confidence that you have earned. Trust the counter. Trust the stretch left. Trust the range. You’ve got this!

MEET DAY 5 03/07 : 24.32m AND NCAA CHAMPION
- Indoor season was capped off in the best way possible - winning my second national title in a row. Honestly it felt like I left something to be desired in the meet - but I am so happy with my mental and physical preparation for this competition and how I handled the emotions in the competition.
- I’ll admit that after round 2 I kind of struggled to find it. I lost my head after not having great feeling on a throw and it still going 24 - I thought I was in for something big. But that could be where the pride kicked in. I felt like I was owed that distance instead of just staying in the moment and trusting my training. A good lesson learned, and more importantly great lessons learned about preparation for competitions - in terms of making sure to be chilled and relaxed the night before hanging with friends, and try to call home or have some chill time before the completion. Positive self talk during the competition - trusting in training. Having the training simulate the competition. This is all very important stuff that we are slowly but surely starting to nail. Thank you God🙏🏾

Monday 03/11 - A: 18lbs x20 67.80 BIG PB B: 9k x12 65.00 BIG PB, 7k x8 72.30
- Still working well on hitting that golf ball on the entry so that it can stretch past me and grow to 180. From there you have to keep relaxed and keep turning to 180. Having a nice sit and counter on the entry and letting it building up are major keys to a big throw. Let it rise and let it be long. Big throws are coming
- This video is only 65ish but a nice example of the entry 
￼
- 9k session was also really nice. I’m very happy that the technical changes to my entry are showing good results with all of the balls now. 7k differential was pretty ugly but I’ll take consistent 70+ for having it be the last ball in a hard day of throws. Hitting that golf ball at zero and then letting it stretch past me as much as possible is proving very beneficial. 
- Dan Pallof described the entry as “an 80m entry”. So I just need to keep letting it build and being relaxed in 3 and 4. The big throws are on the way

Tuesday 03/12 - A: 18lbs x20 66.30
- solid session working the things we were working yesterday. Noticed that you really need to let it grow in 3 and 4. Keep building that orbit to 180. Overall good work tho. Started to feel the fatigue towards the end but I’m holding strong so far
- also really got after it in lift which I was happy about:
    - Snatch from floor
        - 80 x3
        - 85 x3
        - 90 x2
        - 95 x2
        - 100 x1
        - 105 x1 PB
    - Front squat 7s eccentric
        - 415
        - 430
        - 435
        - 450!!

Wednesday 03/13 - A: 18lbs x20 66.50 B: 7k x14 70ish 9k x6 <60
A:
- I’ll take it for a hard session on tired legs. Not too much takeaways but honestly on such tired legs it’s nice to be sat I’ll putting it out there like that. I think some bigger throws are definitely on the way
B:
- another crappy session. Really couldn’t feel that patient entry like I want to. Need to push the ball to zero and then let it run so it can take me round. If you hit zero and then keep that long double support as it builds out to 180, you know big throws are there. 
- Can’t really overthink tough session the day after those eccentrics. Lots of muscle tissue broken down so the body isn’t moving like it was on the previous days. Good rest and recovery tonight should have me feeling better for tomorrow 
- Also 2 things: 1 - I came into todays practice with a distance goal. You know that is not how this works. You come to practice to refine and build the competition technique. If you keep chasing it it won’t come. You know the technique that works. Focus on that and the outcome will take care of itself. 2 - Even when you’re on the struggle bus you keep pushing through. At the end of the day if you keep showing up and keep working the right things, it will come. Some good sessions in a row made my body forget that the work is the work. The body feels that work and sometimes takes a little longer to recover. You’ll be better off for it I can assure you that
- Also I forgot to add that range wins!!! My multithrows today reminded me of this. I’m gonna put a good throw with the 9k from Monday (62ish) and you will see that if you have a good push on 1 and then good patience and let the hammer take you round, and just keep letting the orbit build to 180, the throws will be big
￼
- and just to remind yourself - if your bad session with the 7k is now around 70, then you’re in a pretty good spot if you ask me

Thursday 03/14 - A: 9k x12 62.20 7k x12 72.00
- much better session today. It’s crazy the difference a day can make. Happy to be back over 60 with the 9k and very consistently over 70 with the 7. Nothing too crazy just yet but the consistency above 70 is reminiscent of how I was with the 15 last year - but this ball is even heavier plus is not a ball that I have often been so great with so I really will take it
- Technically it’s so important to have a good push on that entry. Hit that golf ball hard and zero and let it build out whilst keeping the right leg grounded for as long as possible. Then, a NEW* insight is to keep that double support long on the second turn. Land out and then keep that right foot grounded and let the orbit build out again. From there just keep building and letting the orbit grow. My throw is in a good spot I just have to keep grinding
- Also I think that the 9k paired with the 7k (back and forth) is a good session. Getting the heavy work with the 9 whilst still being able to work speed.
- Coach says I can let it run more. And I know that this is true. Whilst my form does look good right now and the distances are promising, I know for a fact that I can be WAYYYYY more relaxed in the throw.

Friday 03/16 - 18lbs x22 EASY
- I am actually delighted with how todays session went. Really just slowed things down and worked the fundamentals. I really like the long double support on 1 AND 2. I feel like it sets up the throw so well. I also need to work hard to get back to relaxed and connected throws. Relaxation of the shoulders I still believe is the number 1 key to big throws. You work the ground and stay patient and let the ball do the work. Obviously is easier said than done, but if you set it up well in 1 and 2, hopefully it should be in a good position for the orbit to grow into 3 and 4.
- Here is a solid technical effort around 55 with the 18
- Amo really likes 1 and 2 but the orbit getting janky in 3 and 4. Need to keep hitting that long double support and pushing well in 3 and 4 or I’ll lose the orbit!! So now the goal is long double support in ALL turns.
￼

￼

Monday 03/18 - 8.5k x8 62ish, 8k x8 63.50, 17lbs x12 67.10 SB
- although distances with other balls were underwhelming, I really started to find some good technique with the 17. Holding those LONG pushes in each turn has proven to be very beneficial. As does letting the orbit build to 180. It’s important to get the arms straight on your hit at zero and then let the ball rise as it runs past you to 180. From there, each turn try to work the ground for as long as possible and turn out (BUILD OUT) to 180.
- Here is a great technical effort with the 17, and my best throw of the day (shoutout to the tripod)
￼
￼

Tuesday 03/19 - 18lbs x14 63.00, 17lbs x12 66.30
- another solid technical day tbh. Weather was quite chilly so I don’t think it was so conducive of good distances, but overall I’d say it was a productive practice. Getting in and hitting the golf ball hard on the entry is major key. From there, keep pushing to 180 (let the ball run past you) and keep the right foot down as long as you possibly can.
- Letting the ball run where it wants to and letting your right leg do the work and keep pushing to 180 (keep the right leg down and push longggggg to 180)
- So now I finally see the value in “push to 180”. It’s not necessarily turning out (that’s part of it), but it’s more about holding that double support and having a long push to 180. Stay long and let it build. I actually think bigger throws are on the horizon
￼

Wednesday 03/20 - 10k 3/4 x16 48.20, 7.26k x12 68.10
- disappointed with the distance on throws with such great feelings - but I will acknowledge that I have an exam later today so maybe the body wasn’t fully there. In any case, the technique felt very good - and if the movement is good then the distance will follow
- Honestly this feeling kind of reminds me of when I went back home to train - meaning that I think it is fundamentally a weight room problem (it’s currently deload week so my body doesn’t have good work on it at all - in terms of full range squats - which it didn’t have for a WHILE in outdoors and I paid the price for that)
- Anyways, technically, some nice takeaways - just working on getting in well and hard on the entry, and then once it’s in letting the hammer run long and wherever it wants to be, and just focusing on LONGGGG double supports each turn.
- in my head I think this throw puts me in about 72-74 shape on the easy week after ONLY heavies for the past while. So I do think that there are far bigger throws to come and next week I should definitely be set up to go big
- I would say that whilst the technique did feel solid - If I want to get the most out of the throw I HAVE to build to 180. I know big throws come out of that
￼

Friday 03/22 - 10k 3/4 x8 47.30, 7.26k x8 70.80
- honestly a solid day out for a short cold morning session at the end of the deload week. I think honestly the technical gains I have made on this deload week once implemented properly will have my throw exactly where I want it to be.
- Today I thought more about sitting on bent legs in the throw. So getting in on one and still working the ball past you, and then letting those arms hang loose and letting the ball go where it wants, then just sitting on deep bent legs and getting out to 180 - making sure you stay on bent legs and resist the urge to rise. If you stay on bent legs with relaxed arms and work to 180 - you finally get the POWER behind your throws that take it the distance
- When you’re sat well, you don’t HAVE to be so steep with the orbit. Cultivate your POWER and ATHLETICISM
￼

Monday 03/25 - 18lbs x8 65.30 (Harvard PB), 17lbs x8 67.10 (=SB), 15lbs x10 74.00 (SB)
- todays takeaway: PUSH THE BALL. Consciously feel your right arm working the ball left and out to 180. Each catch you just have to keep working that right side and pushing the ball so that you don’t get into a dragging position. This results in far throws that feel easy
- Wasn’t using my legs as well as I know I can this session but felt was focused on feeling a good push with the right hand and resulted in some good distances that felt pretty easy and consistent
- Once I get this going on bent legs, with that long double support on entry and consistently turning out and finding 180, big throws are coming
- also from today I’m going to try to get minimum 100 reps of specific strength work done every day. It’s a long season ahead Imma be ready
- But I do need to lock back in to these long double supports - so I need to sit back on bent legs so I can be patient with the legs - my left side is still getting ahead so I’m starting to drag instead of letting the ball run past

Tuesday 03/26 - 18lbs x12 65.00, 17lbs x12 67.60 PB, 15lbs x6 71.70 
- today was a freezing cold day after a really heavy lift last night but still I found some nice technical breakthrough resulting in some solid distances for a tough day on the body and the conditions
- So basically relaxation still implies - todays keyword was BALANCE. Feeling the right arm guiding that ball to 180. It’s a push, yes, but not an EXTREME push. Especially when the body is on, don’t overpush it. Stay strong with the right push but focus on relaxation and not getting ahead of the ball. Keep finding 180 all throughout the throw and you’ll hit big ones
- Long season ahead kid, keep working

Wednesday 03/27 - 17lbs x10 67.50, 15lbs x10 73.00
- nice technical addition was to squat into the entry. Definitley felt like I could set the ball up much better - and you feel those right arm pushes much more especially with the 17
- For throwing the 15 i realized that I didn’t need to kill it on the entry - much smoother on one and even two sets up the pushes on three and 4 much better. The connection looks better, it’s consistently solid, and I think it has far better likelihood of transferring to the meet better
- As always - the basic cue of finding 180 in EVERY turn will always be of upmost importance also
- SMOOTH ON 1 AND 2 - GUIDE IT OUT WITH THE RIGHT HAND AND THEN PUSH 3 AND 4
￼

Meet Day 1 03/29 : 72.94m
- technically, I think the meet was solid. The distance is a little disappointing, but it was a very accurate representation of where I’m at with the 15 which definitely increases my confidence in that as the general indicator ball. I think that I didn’t trust pushing with the right side in the first 4 rounds, and that caused me to run into some problems. The last two rounds I just let go and finally trusted the right hand push and it resulted in better throws - throws that had I produced in the earlier rounds probably would’ve put me more in the 75-76 region than the 72-73. 
- It’s all good tho, coming off of the first meet hungry for more is a solid enough place to be. I know there is far more in there and im on the cusp of something big
- Amos take is that I need to once again start bending my legs in the winds in order to get my hips under me. I agree with this and if keeping the hips forward allows me to get the bend in my legs that I know allows me to express my power into the throw. So im going back to that Kenny start with the bend and the hips forward, whilst still maintaining the push. If this is the piece of the puzzle I was missing then it’s game time for big throws. In any case, 3 weeks of grind and then it’s down to Auburn to push the mark even further
￼
￼

Monday 04/01 - 9k x16 62.30 (Harvard PB), 17lbs x14 67.40
- a solid day with some decent technical learnings plus some high volume that will definitely pay off down the stretch
- Technically, with the 9k I learnt about starting the push from earlier. What this means is starting pushing the hand from when they’re behind your head, and still stay patient to let the ball go past you
- Also, I found some really nice connection with feeling my right hand push ALL the way to 180. Basically I don’t want to be in and out of the push. Once the push starts i want to stay “IN THE PUSH”. So basically push all the way round to 180 and don’t stop pushing the entire throw
- Also, I’m back on those LONG double supports in all 4 turns. I really like how it feels to have those long double supports especially on the later turns. And if you couple that with the right hand push - BIG things will come
- Last but not least I of course had to think about keeping my hips more forward on the entry so I don’t just drop them back in the meet. Still a work in progress but it’s a little better
￼

Tuesday 04/02 - 9k x14, 17lbs x14
- not so good a session technically, but came to a lot of realizations about my technique and basically the conclusion that the technique I am throwing with now is simply NOT the technique I want to use. I must take a few steps backwards if I want to move forward, and I think the biggest part of that is going to be my entry. Before, I knew whether a throw would be good or not straight off of the entry - and I’ve heard many high level hammer throwers say the same thing. 
- I think it will fundamentally start with a flatter entry. I think “hitting the golf ball” is actually quite a nice analogy, but instead of the golf ball, I’m going for more of baseball hit. Basically I don’t know how long it’s going to take but I need to find “MY THROW” again. I think the fact that I’m putting good distances out without even throwing the way I throw just shows me that I’m capable of much more. Especially when mixed with some of the other things I have been working aswell like the long double supports.
- I also found today that the higher hands on the entry helped me actually feel some tension which was great.
- Also, like what I discovered in Houston, if you actually have a great hit on that entry and actually get in with intent, you actually can just stay relaxed and let the ball do the work
- And, I think I need to have a healthy amount of standard and light. And lean far more on the light side. Like this is just how I train. I think I’ve made enough specific strength gains to last me through the season. Don’t get me wrong, I’m not done throwing heavy, but like throwing even the 9k makes having a flat entry quite difficult and I really just need to focus on getting my technique back

Wednesday 04/03 - 7.26k x20 70.40, 15lbs x20 71.20
- okay this is the first session in a long time that I have actually begun to feel some tension on the ball. It all starts with the entry. Hips forward and HIT THE ENTRY FLAT. Get in FLAT AT ZERO and strike the ball left. From there it is CRUCIAL to find direction from the first turn. Once you get in on one TURN OUT straight away - direction is so crucial. If you can get to the point where you can see out and react and turn out EVERY TURN, then you’re cooking
- I’m happy with this as a first session of trying to get the old me back. It will come. These changes will take time to actualise but when they do I will be far better off for it
- this is the technique that I BELIEVE will get me to 80m
- Do this on bent legs and I think SCARY results will come👀

Friday 04/05 - 17lbs x20 64.50
- unfortunate distance for what actually felt like a pretty good technical day. Struck the ball left and focused on keeping my hips forward on the entry and focusing on turning out especially turning my hips out to 180. Staying relaxed and letting the ball go where it wants, but very consciously keeping the head seeing 180 in every turn. 
- We also lifted at 8:30 in the morning so I’m sure the distance doesn’t fully do justice to the technique
￼

Saturday 04/06 - 7k x20 NET
- actually a very productive session for so early in the morning. Got much more bent in my legs (and pre bent my legs before the winds - like NCAAs). It’s a work in progress but feels much more like I can strike it left and then keep working and building as the tunes go on
- This bent legs is exactly what I’ve been after and some time of putting this together with different balls will pay major dividends I know it
￼

Monday 04/08 - 18lbs x12 64.00, 15lbs x12 72.00
- good movement today characterised by good bend in the legs, a good flat strike out left on the entry, and then just staying relaxed and on bent legs from the start to finish turning out. The movement is far more dynamic with bent legs and relaxed arms and is capable of some amazing distances when the time will come
￼

Tuesday 04/09 - 18lbs x10 NM, 15lbs x14 73.50
- after some bad work and honestly feeling like I was getting cooked with the 18, I was able to find some great stuff with the 15
- The key concept is basically to STRIKE THE BALL OUT LEFT ON ENTRY. It’s major key to send that ball out left with maximum length and relaxation. Basically you are hitting the ball out left hard, and then just relaxing the arms as best as possible and turning out on bent legs.
- Also, going back to the dynamic entry whilst setting up nicely on bent legs helped a lot with getting good entry speed
- Now that I’m going into more speed work with the 14lbs this week and next, I’m excited for what I can do once I get the timing of turning out whilst at high speed back. The specific strength and the movement is certainly getting there I know that - I just need to get that dynamic feeling back to get things back where I want them

Thursday 04/11 - A: 16lbs x16 NM, B: 17lbs x12 66.50 14lbs x7 72.20
A:
- this was an okay session but I think the main thing it showed me was just that I don’t really need to practice with the 16 so much. At the end of the day I think it’s most important that I’m able to have high speeds whilst maintaining length - and whilst I think I’m starting to nail the speed part of that equation wacking the ball left on my entry - I haven’t quite gotten that range part back. And I’m gonna need it to be able to get to where I want to be
- I know the movement is definitely starting to come back. I just need the distance to start picking up again
B: 
- much better today getting back to letting the orbit build out to 180. Still there is work too be done, but I’m happy to strike the ball left on one and make sure to get down and out. And then keep letting the orbit build out to 180 as the throw goes. As I get used to the 14 I definitley expect distances to pick up. For now I’m okay with this and I’m happy with the feels associated with the flat entry and first turn then building out 

Friday 04/12 - 14lbs x20 74.20 PB
- Blessed. I know it’s not perfect just yet but I truly believe it’s getting closer.
- Today I focused on SITTING ON THE CATCH. So basically staying down on bent legs during the throw and not allowing the hammer to pull me up. It’s still a work in progress but just having the feeling of bent legs in the winds and then trying to sit deeper and deeper in the turns gives me much better catch positions - and so I know that when the time comes it will give me much better distance
- Also I put my grip back to the regular side of the hammer. Dunno why I switched but this is completely fine
￼

Monday 04/15 - 17lbs x20 66.00, 14lbs x14 74.20 (=PB)
- Today was a VERY interesting session. Brooks came in and said a very interesting technical piece that really surprised me. He said I should find the impulse (strike left) on my FIRST wind, and then on the second wind just try and collect the hammer as far back as humanly possible. From back there - I keep the first turn flat and long and connected from far back (don’t let the ball rise on the first - keep it flat and long to the left). From there you stay long and DO NOTHING - it feels slow but the orbit is so much longer and once you can get some speed with that length I feel like big things will come. The technical piece relies heavily on GREAT bend in the legs. This is what sets up a good long double support and allows you to set the longggg first turn up
- Interestingly, I got a word from God after praying on my technique. The word was along the lines of to work the same thing I worked last year. I thought it meant last season (as in indoor season) but this just goes to show that God always has a plan. Last year I was really trying to work range. And it seems that we are at long last starting to get it back. I will keep working this throughought the week, but it feels very promising for a big competition throw

Tuesday 04/16 - 15lbs x20 NM
- okay so today was not good. Best of the day was 72 but generally very inconsistent and most of my throws were either dumps or bad. I only had 1 throw over 70. As much as I find this concept that brooks brought up really quite interesting, perhaps doing it right in the middle of the season is not a good idea. I was working on some great things and I was about to make a big change dead in the middle of the season - quite like what was happening in the UK. I think that generally, the technique you have in the season is the technique you have. You’ve got Ito trust it and trust that the programming will set you up to go far.
- One thing I have, however , gained from this is just how low I can really go in the throw in terms of my depth
- if I can keep this depth with my regular entry and make sure I stay down when the ball is at the high point, then I am, simply put, COOKING
- Also whilst working on this I have been able to think more about the flatness I’ve my entry all the way through the entry.
- Also I need to lock back in to those long double supports. But yeh I think this is the end of project swing all the way back - it’s just not comfortable for me

Wednesday 04/17 - 14lbs x10 75.20 PB
- Im happy with todays session and glad I was able to get back to good throwing. There is not going to be some magic formula to big throws but I simply just have to keep doing what I have been trying to do since last year but keep pushing forward
- Sit, strike it left, AND KEEP THE SHOULDERS RELAXED. Get out and beat the ball out. Relaxation is the most important thing. Sit deep, stay relaxed and beat the ball as you turn out (so turn the body in on your catch). Relaxation and build. You’re in great shape. You know what to do. Lets have fun this weekend

Friday 04/19 - Pre meet 7.26x7
- Average was probably around 67/68 ish which of course is not ideal but I know how the game goes now and so I know that having that distance is premeet is CERTAINLY not anything to worry about. The important thing was that the feelings were solid and I have good technical takeaways to take into tomorrow. The most important of those is to TURN OUT. It’s so important to make sure I am getting out every turn and taking the ball out to 180. Other than that, just stay relaxed and have fun out there - you know what to do

Meet Day 2 04/20: 74.47m SB 
- second best meet of my life and it’s only my second meet of the season. So things are looking good. I stayed confident in my technique and even after a premeet where distances were not great, I’ve made some great progress.
- Technically, I focused on making sure I keep my entry flat (it slightly off to the right but be disciplined to keep it flat). From there, just stay relaxed and TURN TF OUT. Having direction is such a major key as is relaxation. Relaxation is the difference between my 69 opener and my 73 round 2
- The thing I best figured out this meet was having that entry flat and long to the left. Flatter than you think. It seems slightly turning the hands over kind of helped with getting that flat entry
- Then round six showed that if you put some bent legs on that flat entry… big things can come
- In terms of improvements, Amo mentioned a simple fix of having more relaxation in my first swing. Relaxed on the first wind, flat and long to the left on the entry. Then just stay relaxed and keep turning out
￼

Monday 04/22 - 17lbs x12 69.10 PB, 6k x12 77.20
- Happy with the fix to the swings and it really helped me get much better feeling of range and length on the entry. So it’s first wind relax, second wind slice it flat and to the left. Then once your in, stay disciplined to keep the relaxation and turn out each turn. Make sure to really grind to get that force with the legs in 3 and 4
- Also I found great consistency with doing a squat at the setup to feel good depth in the legs and then come up into the position I want to be in. It gave me consistent depth in the legs which gives great force to the ball
- Also the slight twist of the hand on the entry to get that flatness was very helpful. Just make sure to get the hand back to regular by time the ball is at 180 and then just keep the hands neutral and relaxed as the throw goes. Tbh get the hand neutral after the hammer passes zero
- I’m happy to have finally broken through that barrier and properly broken my pb last year with the 17. It gives me great confidence.

Tuesday 04/23 - 6k x14 80.50 PB, 17lbs x6 NM
- glad to have finally broken past the 80m barrier with the 6k for the first time in my life. This is definitely something to be happy for. But of course, this can come with the mind being too excited and thinking too much about these distances. I know they are possible and this session has shown me that I am more than capable of hitting these when the time is right. All glory to God.
- For now, the big technical focus was RELAXATION IN 2. This set up the rest of the throw very nicely. So I have a relaxed first wind, then I have a flat strike left on the entry (can turn the hand on the right side but make sure to level it out at zero), then from there, ENSURE THAT YOU ARE RELAXED IN TURN TWO. This sets up the relaxation in the rest of the throw and is a major key for big throws
- Also the squat before the winds has been a big help for really feeling down on bent legs
- I also thought today about hitting that right foot down harder in the later turns and really working the ground. Jury is still out on that but we will see
- Penn relays this Thursday. Feeling in good shape. Simply must stay focused and be present and in the moment. Competing against other top guys in the east thank God and EXECUTE!!!

Meet day 3 04/25 : 74.15m 
- penn relays was a little more disappointing this year. The level of competition was very low to be fair but yeah it resulted in a 74 and a series that I’m not too happy with. To be honest tho, I can’t be too mad. It’s very early days - even earlier than I am thinking in my head. My plan is to throw very far much later in the year so I just need to trust the process and keep the ball rolling. The fact is, I came into this meet chasing a big throw that I know is in me. But the obvious fact is that I need to focus on the input. Back to work. Head down. Focused. There is a LONG time until the big one needs to come. Breakthrough is on the way I just need to focus on the process
- Technically, I will admit that I did not trust the twist had technique that I had in practice. Admittedly, I had only been working it for 2 days of practice so obviously my mind resorted back to what I know. So I know that if I just keep focusing on the input and getting the consistency in my technique at practice, it will translate to the meet. Can not at all be mad at another 74+ throw whilst LITERALLY CHASING DISTANCE. Once I lock back in to just focusing on the circle and letting the distance work itself out, the big throws will come. I’m glad I’m learning what needs to be learned
- Technically, what made my 74 go 74 was definitley my entry. I didn’t allow my head to go back on the wind, like Amo spoke about last week. I kept the wind central and was sure to hit my entry in front of me. And then I focused on keeping it flat even as it goes out to the left. Flat out to the left is major. Don’t let it rise on you or your screwed. If you set yourself up this way on the entry long and flat to the left, it allows you to stay relaxed in 2 so that it can stay flat then aswell. Then you just build out and big throws will come. Don’t be too mad. Going to a competition means putting yourself out there and testing your technique in competition. You’re close to something big, you’ve simply just got to let it happen. It will come, just keep working
￼
Friday 04/26 - 17lbs x16 66.50
- for today the focus was getting the relaxation in that second wind. So not trying to hit the entry like a baseball but more trying to whip it in flat whilst still keeping my relaxation in the entry. Putting the shoulders back as you’re winding and entering helps with having the relaxation on entry. Get it in flat and relaxed and then just stay relaxed. The movement was solid today, just bad speed. But it WILL come. I guarantee it

Saturday 04/27 - 6k x16 79.20
- relaxation is EVERYTHING. If you are wanting to chase bigger throws, then chase more relaxation. The ncaa is heating up - it’s about time to lean into what you KNOW you are world class at : RELAXATION AND SPEED. It has been that way since you were a kid. It’s time to lean in
- Relaxation on winds by putting the shoulders back and countering against the ball in the winds - then just keep this relaxation going into the FLAT entry and then from there just keep the orbit flat and let the ball run long and turn out. Big throws to come

Monday 04/29 - 17lbs x10 66.50, 7.26k 3/4 x10 59.00 PB
- today I was just continuing the idea of keeping long and relaxed on both of my winds by manipulating the body to feel tension off of one and have better rhythm that rushing that entry. Although the distances weren’t so strong the feelings were very good today so I think I just need to keep working these and let the body adapt to the timing. Trust me it will come
- The only point I would make from that 69 session I had with the 17 was the slight hand tilt on entry that I was working in for a flatter entry (I know my 77 was the flattest entry of the comp). If I really want to lock that in then I need to keep working it
- I also make the argument that this new way I’m going into my entry may not be the best way for me to set up my entry 
- BUT: I make the point that I believe wholeheartedly that my technique is in the best and most consistent place that it has been in. This is the most consistent and relaxed my technique has been. DO THIS IN A MEET AND ITS GOING BIG

Tuesday 04/30 - 7.26k 3/4 x15 60.70 PB
- good short session with the speed ball. Had a new pb and good consistency in the high 50s. Still just locked my focus into those relaxed winds and that relaxed and flat entry. From there just staying relaxed and seeing 180 each turn. Big throws to come for sure
- Also thought about keeping the right foot grounded for a more powerful entry position. Still needs work but I’ll get it

Thursday 05/02 - 6k x15 81.00 PB
- definitley my best and most consistent session with the 6k, probably 5 throws 78.50+, with 2 throws over 80 and an 81m
- Technically, I chased MORE AND MORE RELAXATION EACH THROW. Any time I wanted to throw further I just thought to get even more relaxation. I also thought well about WORKING THE RIGHT LEG ON THE GROUND each turn. Skateboard right leg drive on the entry (a long drive aswell - don’t short it) and then keep turning out and driving the right leg each turn
- Also remember to keep the swings completely relaxed and in front of you. Technically things are in a great place, and you’re finally starting to move. Now is the time to capitalise. Best of luck at heps. Chase relaxation and the big throws will come.

Friday 05/03 - 7.26k x6 HEPs pre meet
- Solid pre meet throws at comfortable training distances. Relaxed winds in front of you - with complete relaxation going into the entry. From there, big push with the right foot each turn - especially off that entry. Then just make sure you’re consciously turning out, staying long, and pushing the speed. Big throws to come just stay relaxed and trust the process. All the best tomorrow

Meet Day 4 05/04 - 73.33m
- I’m honestly really disappointed with the meet. For me today, the technique felt quite reminiscent of British champs (also characterised by a fall in round 5). The truth is it just wasn’t there. I didn’t execute on what needed to be executed on, and I paid the price. I think the length and connection I am finding with the 6k has simply not yet manifest itself with the 7.26 - but I genuinely believe it’s there. I just think that my connection with the ball feels best when I’m getting reps in the 15/14 balls that are more similar to the competition feeling. Throwing the 16 like it’s a 6k is not setting me up for my ultimate success.
- Simple put, I have to be better. No 2 ways about it
- Not long enough on the winds. Not low enough on the legs. No rhythm no connection. I’ve got to do better. Getting wayyyy to steep too early. Have to be flat on 1 AND 2 and let it build in 3 and 4. It would help if I actually kept some high quality bend in my legs. My biggest issue all season has been that it’s getting too steep on me. DONT LET IT RISE. FLATTER THAN YOU EVEN THINK
- Also maybe no more redbull at meets? Seems to do more harm than good in the hammer

Thursday 05/09 - 9k 3/4 x20 51.80 PB
- Today was a pretty good session for me with the short 9. I don’t actually think that the distance was so spectacular but the technique felt good and I had really great consistency aswell
- Technically, I put more weight on my right foot in the winds so that I can keep a stable right foot during the winds to be in a stronger position on entry. For my winds, I’m swinging OUT in front of me - then I need to hit the entry out in front of me.
- Then I just stay relaxed and keep my head on the ball and stay relaxed and connected. Bigger throws are definitely on the horizon I’m sure

Friday 05/10 - 9k 3/4 x12 54.00 PB, 15lbs x12 74.20 SB
- big step in the right direction technically, as shown by the seasons best with the indicator ball and big pb with the short heavy. Also had 2 throws of 74 with the 15 which means we are definitely doing the right things.
- Technically, I am still keeping my weight on my right foot so that I am keeping a strong and stable right foot in the winds. Then, I push the ball past me to the left on my entry - keeping a good long pushing with the right foot. Then I’m working working the ground hard, staying relaxed and staying connected with the ball. Need to keep working it but some big throws to come for sure
- To work on is just getting the relaxation I need and also staying down on the right side even as I push the ball past me

Saturday 05/11 - 17lbs x10 66.80, 15lbs x10 72.60
- unfortunately the distance today didn’t feel like it fully reflected the technique as well as I would have liked. Oh well it’s in early Saturday morning session by myself after not getting a great sleep and having a heavy pin squat (remind me to do the front ways - hurt my knees) session yesterday. So all in all I’ll take the positives and keep it pushing
- Technically, I still stayed on the train of keeping that right side heavy and grounded in the winds and the entry. Tried to keep my winds more relaxed and remember to stay taller with my upper back in the winds in order to get that flatter entry.
- From there I just need to keep my head on the hall throughought and stay relaxed to let the orbit build. I’m still getting into a dragging position in the later turns. Less so than before but I still am. Keep the head on the ball in 3 and 4 and it’s money I believe. You’re really really close it’s just the little things now. But these little things are very important. I know the breakthrough is going to come soon you just have to keep believing and keep working
- Also I really believe that more bend in the legs will allow me to get more distance on these balls aswell. Man put everything together and you’ll really be cooking I promise you

Tuesday 05/15 - 17lbs x12 65.60, 15lbs x12 72.00
- honestly some disappointing distances for what i thought was some solid technique. I tried to keep the hips more forward. I felt like it was setting up some solid feelings but it seems that I couldn’t get it done the way I envisioned. Such is life. I’m gonna keep pushing and finding new ways to elevate. For the next session my key and maybe focus will be getting back on bent legs - and maybe trying out swinging back a little bit more (hit left off of the right foot)
- Overall I’m just really trying to find it. Scary but it will come I truly believe. My front squat position is ultra strong. I know I can sit deep and have hips forward. If not I can even bring the hips back abit. I think it will be fine.
- It this catch vs this catch in two

Wednesday 05/15 - 16lbs x12 71.00, 12lbs x12 80.50
- Honestly I’ll take it. I’m excited for this block and feel like it has the potential to move me in a great direction towards where I want to be. I sat deep on the entry which I think definitely helped cultivate some more power in my throws. Also, I think I need to commit to working with the push - and just figuring out where I need to apply the push and the balance that I need in it. I believe that this is what I need to take the next step - I just need balance with it. Push the ball and generate power - trying to do some more right arm turns to feel the right side push in the active phase
- Trust it and keep building. This block is where a boy turns to a man I can feel it

Thursday 05/16 - 16lbs x20 71.60 
- today I believe I took another step in the right direction, with some actual consistency over 70 during a Harvard training session which is always beautiful. 
- Today, to God be the glory, I finally felt some tension. Like not that fake tension but genuine real tension for multiple throws in the session. I came in today looking to add a firm back to my sitting work that I did yesterday. So I’m sitting down with a firm back kind of like a front squat.
- I then added swinging a little more back (like maybe just off the right foot). Then just staying LONGGGGG in the first turn to set up the throw. Let the range dictate the speed not the other way round. This is what connection feels like. Not looking at the ball, but the true feeling of connection which is when the tension is growing in the system
- So, I’m going to keep working. Keep trying to find the tension and the increasing length and acceleration in throw. It’s not there yet I know but to God be the glory I think I’m on the way
- For tomorrow I’m going to keep at it. The only difference I think is to stilll have that right side lean in the winds. I feel like that firm right foot entry was very beneficial for sure


Saturday 05/18 - 16lbs x10 72.00, 12lbs x10 79.80
- glory to God. The connection is finally beginning to come back. Swinging with my back strong and then sitting into the entry with relaxed arms making sure to get length left on the entry. Long to the left on one - then just keep turning out and keeping your connection. There are big throws to come. Just keep focused and keep working and THANKING GOD

Tuesday 05/21 - 7.26 x5 Pre Meet
- technique is feeling 100% solid. Minimal complaints. Keep the winds relaxed. Stay relaxed all throughought the throw. Good length left on the entry, counter in the winds and on the entry sit back and counter as you let it stretch left. Front there, just stay long and relaxed and turn out. Connection is everything. Big throws to come

Meet day 5 05/22 : 68.55m
- series was: X, X, 68.55. I don’t have the words right now to be honest. But I DO NOT blame God for this at ALL. Thank you to the Lord for helping me refind my feelings that I lost initially. It’s not what I want at all but I have to just learn the lessons and move on. I’m disappointed but I’m not defeated. I’ll take the lessons and I’ll keep it pushing
- From a technical standpoint, it’s honestly not far off. I can trust and allow my winds to be more relaxed, and I can trust and allow my counter on the entry to be more back and more deeper. This will cause a flatter entry which I really struggled with today. Those videos look steeper on entry than I would like for sure. It’s close I just have to get in and get flat on that entry
- You’ve got this. Dial in hard this week and 

Thursday 05/23 - 16lbs x18 71+
- had a great session after yesterday which definitely does remind me that I am in great shape. I had some more right foot dominance in the winds, and I made my entry MORE LEVEL. This allows the orbit to grow much better and set up some great feeling in the throw. Sit and counter, level on entry, turn out relaxed. The big one is coming 

Friday 05/24 - 16lbs x20 74.20 TRAINING PB?
-  another great session following up from yesterday. It took me a while to get into my throwing as it was early morning but once I started to hit it I really started to hit it. Biggest thing today was having a deeper sit on that entry. I like the level entry, I like the weight in the right foot, I like the relaxation and winding off of that right foot - the biggest thing is to trust the counter and sit DEEP on that entry. That was giving consistent 72+ throws
- Also if you sit deep on the legs you will NEVER foot foul. Your lined up trust me just trust God and trust the process
￼
Saturday 05/25 - 16lbs x20 72.50ish
- another solid session. Not as great and consistent as yesterday but after a long squat day and training day yesterday I’ll take it.
- Staying level off of that first turn with a deep bend in the legs and relaxation in the arms is a major key. When your level is so much easier to be connected and find 180 each turn. I think that I’m very close to finding some very big throws. Just gotta keep pushing 

Tuesday 05/28 - 16lbs x10 69ish, 6k x10 77ish
- really picked it up with the 6k and found some technique I was very happy with. It seems that the right foot lean is very important in terms of me being able to feel level on the entry - so it stays
- The biggest takeaway from today was: STAY DOWN IN 3 AND 4. If you allow the hall to let you rise you will be in much worse catch positions. Imagine there’s a ceiling above your head and you have to stay beneath it throughought all of your turns. If you do that and continue to turn out every time - BIG throws are on the horizon for sure. 
- These are two good balls with the 6k where I have right foot lean, level on one, staying down on the legs, AND TURNING OUT. Do these all on relaxed arms and the catch positions will be beautiful 

Wednesday 05/29 - 7.26k x12 71.30, 6k x12 79.70
- a good session today following up on the learnings from yesterday. Today we kept loading the right leg in the winds and sitting deep on the entry. Main difference was focusing on swinging even more back (just behind the right leg) and then sitting deep and having a really long push on the entry (focus on getting long and connected not necessarily moving tsp fast)
- Also, A MAJOR KEY IS SITTING DEEP AND STAYING DEEP IN 3 AND 4. When you do this you are always safe in the circle and always setting yourself up for big tosses
- You’re ready to throw VERY far. I promise

Thursday 05/30 - 7.26k x10 70.30, 6k x10 76.80
- whilst the distances are nothing to call home about AT ALL - I KNOW I have nothing to worry about. The feeling is there, and the peak will do the work. I’m swinging back and focusing on being patient and long on the first turn whilst being deep in bent legs. It is setting up a great radius and a great acceleration pattern as I feel the tension build. A big thing I need to do is just make sure I keep the arms relaxed and let the ball go into a nice orbit
- I believe that even whilst being patient and long in my entry I can still give more impulse / get in harder on one. I will do it on my 6k session on Saturday and see the results, but basically I just need to increase the impulse whilst staying patient and seeing that ball behind me go the whole way round so I’m long and connected. Once I’m there… it’s up. You’ll see come Saturday, and then most importantly you’ll see come Wednesday 

Saturday 06/01 - 6k x12
- last home practice before heading to Eugene. Was honestly not so bad with multiples balls clearly over my best ball with the 6k last practice. Big thing for me was just continuing to work off what I was working on before - but this time having some more force on the impulse like I said. Resulted in some nice good tosses. Just make sure to stay patient - allow the ball to go to its natural low point when you push on the entry. Then from there stay long and keep turning out. Big tosses to come
- Come nationals, I want to sit deep and have and exaggeratingly flat entry. If I do both those things, and just stay relaxed and on bent legs through all the turns and keep turning out. I WILL WIN. Don’t be afraid to get in hard on one to keep it flat and level

Monday 06/03 - 16lbs x12 Pre pre meet (74ish)
- first practice out here in Oregon was definitely solid. Consistently over 70 with a best close to the 75 line. Still must stay focused, there are much bigger throws that will come on Wednesday.
- Technically, the winds are where I want them. Remember to keep the relaxation and trust the relaxation in competition. This is a major key of the throw. Also, TRUST THE SIT. On that entry sit even deeper than you think. The deeper the better. That sit keeps you level and keeps you relaxed. SIT, RELAXED, LEVEL, TURN OUT. You stay relaxed and have direction in each turn whilst staying deep down on the legs, big throws are coming I promise. Trust relaxation, trust sitting, trust God. YOU WILL WIN THIS MEET. Stay reactive with the feet on the catch. Strong ankles great reactivity

Tuesday 06/04 - 7.26k x6 PRE MEET
- you are ready. 5 throws minimum 71, rest 72-74 region.
- Down, direction, relaxation. That’s all you needs. You’re ready.

Meet day 6 06/05 : 77.12m SB 
- this meet is just the beginning. I stuck to my technical guns, stayed relaxed in the winds, sat deep on the legs, and produced a throw that doesn’t even feel close to what I’m capable of and yet is still 3m further than I’ve got this year. The big one is definitely very close by. It’s time to punch my ticket!
- Thank you God
￼

Friday 06/07 - 7.26k x16 
- another great session just continuing to work on down, direction and relaxation. Especially relaxation in the winds is such a major key, as is sitting DEEP on the legs even deeper than you think. Something I found at the end of the session that helped me a lot on that entry was finding length to the left on my entry. I don’t have to lift it up to find that length, I can just send it long and left then stay down and find direction in the throw. Send it to the left to help not being to heavy on that right side
- Even tho I must say letting it grow to the left made for a very nice looking throw so maybe we’re onto something. We’ll see. In any case I’m ready to go big on Sunday for sure
￼

Saturday 06/08 - 7.26k x12 PRE MEET
- definitely ready to go tomorrow. Swing back nice and easy so you keep the arms ultra relaxed. Don’t tighten up the arms on the entry even if the winds feel slow. Nice and easy and long is the way to go on the entry. Then sit deep and enter long and level. Winds long, relaxed and back. Turn down, direct, and relaxed. The big one is coming
￼

Meet day 7 06/09 : 74.56m
- honestly I’m not too mad at it. I think the technique on this throw was very close to where I want it to be and I can definitely set myself to go very big in Canada. Training through these meets didn’t particularly give me the legs that I really wanted in the meet. Took more throws yesterday than needed and CERTAINLY did not need to take 4 warm up throws. This is definitely a training meet with a plan of setting me up to go big in the meets to come
- Technically, on this throw I had my relaxation and ease on the winds, and I kept the entry level very nicely. Trying to have that impulse too far back messed me up in r4 and I kinda just didn’t recover from that unfortunately. It definitely doesn’t help when you take more warm ups than you need to. Still tho I’m feeling strong and I know that it’s coming. Need to get some good direction back in because I felt like I didn’t fully have that locked in for my throws nor did I have that same relaxation in 3 and 4. More of that and the big one is there
￼

Tuesday 06/11 - 7.26k x16 74ish, 6k x5 79ish
- You’re ready to throw far. C WITH BACK. RELAXED AND FLAT ALL THE WAY ROUND. FLATTER THAN YOU THINK. THEN JUST STAY RELAXED AND KEEP TURNING OUT. HONESTLY NO NEED TO SHOUT. CHASE TECHNIQUE AND KNOW WHEN ITS A GOOD BALL
- So let the back curve and get the ball behind you on the winds as you wind on that right foot. Then keep that ball even flatter than you think all the way round whilst sitting deep on the legs and establishing that connection. From there, just stay relaxed and turn out. BIG throws to come
￼

Wednesday 06/12 - 7.26 x8 PRE MEET 
- I’m ready
- With the C back on entry, be COMPLETELY RELAXED in the winds. The C back helps you do this and still feel tension at the beginning. This is the way. This is the way to those 77+ throws. Last throw of the premeet gave me that exact feeling I’m looking for. IM READY. C back, relaxation on the winds, turn out relaxed. Let it be free.

Meet day 8 06/13 : 76.95m
- I’m happy with this meet. Very happy. I feel that I kept my composure and focused on my technical execution and was able to get the win in a heavily contested field. I know I have bigger throws in me and I will keep pushing towards those - but for now I’m just so thankful to God for the win and the consistency that gives me confidence going into these next competitions.
- Technically, it’s ALL ABOUT THE RELAXATION ALL THE WAY THROUGH THE THROW. Don’t let the orbit get steep. Stay level all the way through the throw. Flat entry and then stay relaxed and level. C with the back, completely relaxed in the winds, start flat and stay flat through as many turns as possible. Thank you God. The big one is on the way. STAY RELAXED IN 3 AND 4!!!
￼

Friday 06/14 - 7.26k x8, 6k x3
- today I was not quite connected but I made good technical adjustments after the meet.
- The big things from the meet were: 1) FLAT ORBIT ON ONE, 2) RELAXATION IN THE C WIND, 3) STAYING RELAXED AND CONNECTED IN THE WHOLE THROW
- From the meet I had to work on not landing too heavy on the right side. To fix this, I took away that general lean I have on the right foot and instead kept my weight distribution neutral. With neutral distribution I still keep the relaxed C winds off of my right foot (be intentional about swinging back to the right foot). Then from there sit and enter even flatter than you think (even if it feels like you’re going down to the left with the arms that’s fine). Then just maintain relaxation and let the ball build
￼

Saturday 06/15 - 7.26k x9 PRE MEET
- I’m ready
- Remember, winds are relaxed all the way through - C in the back and also move it to come around. So you can wiggle a little bit in the winds in order to have ZERO input on those winds. From there, entry flat, sit deep, turn out, AND GO. Big throws to come

Meet day 9 06/16 : 73.55m
- a bad meet but I’m not going to read too much into it. The only thing id say is that I think the weight on the right foot is likely the better option since it better helps me be flat on entry
- Also I’m really happy with how I pulled myself out of a very bad start to the comp to get the win. I just told myself to focus on complete relaxation. Did some explosive breathing and told myself I was in complete control

Wednesday 06/19 - A: 8k x6 70.50 PB, B: 8k x14 67.00
A:
- unfortunately had to stop the session early due to some trunk pain which is pretty tough. The session was literally within an hour of me waking up so I must admit it was probably ill advised on my part. But I think that I was technically going to line things up very well and even throw much further than that so I’m happy and excited to see where I’ll be at once I’m moving. For now tho I’ll take it. Just need to heal up so the body feels okay and be ready for the afternoon session
- Technically - my main adjustment was just striking it out in front of me on my entry. If I can strike it out even higher up it will favor a flatter entry much more and I’ll be cooking. C in the back for relaxed winds, then strike out high and move. Remember that bent legs in the beginning of everything
B:
- This was a better session. I loaded the right leg very well and intentionally on the winds - I raised my hands higher (can also look into incorporating better C in the back) in the winds at the high point which led to me more easily to find a flat entry which is major key. From there, striking the ball out in front on me did make a difference in terms of how well I could move the ball. May be the change I needed if I can get it consistent. For now a solid day and my body is healing up and feeling better so I’m excited for the rest of camp

Thursday 06/20 - A: 8k x12 69.00, B: 9k 1/2 x9 46.10
A:
- really starting to figure it out. Raising the ball higher at the high point combined with pushing/striking the ball in front of you/to zero and then just remaining on bent legs and keep on turning. This session had multiple 68+ throws. We’re starting to cook
￼
B:
- more of the same stuff. The technique feels solid and consistent

Friday 06/21 - A: 8k x14 70.70 PB, B: 9k 1/2 x10 47.80
A:
- good session. Hands high on the winds, sitting deep and stay deep. Hit the ball out in front of you - more back than usual. Like more off the right foot. Then just keep it level by sitting deep and just turn out!
￼
B:
- great session working those same things. High hands, push out on entry to get that length away from you. Also on entry keep the hands from rising. Imagine there is a shelf and you cannot go to low or too high - keep it level the whole way round
￼

Sunday 06/23 - 7.26k x12 71.80, 6k x4 82.00 PB
- The 16 was generally disappointing but I shouldn’t be too pressed. I had good positions but poor movement - in terms of relaxation and connection. The most important aspects of the throw are bent legs and RELAXATION.
- Hand high in the winds but then keep the shoulders relaxed and let the ball be level LOWER and more naturally. With the 6k you were able to find that balance and connection very well. Just start relaxed, stay relaxed, and TRUST THE RELAXATION.
- Get low, swing high, relaxed strike to zero, and then just stay relaxed and keep turning out. Stay flat by having great bend in the legs and great relaxation. The big one is coming trust me
￼

Monday 06/24 - 7.26k x8 73.80, 6k x4 82.10 PB
- the word of the day today was: RELAXATION. This gets you’re connection going. Long and level on the entry, striking out long to zero and sitting deep on the legs. From there, stay deep on the legs, stay relaxed in the shoulders, and keep turning out. Sitting deep on you’re entry and striking out to 0 relaxed is the major key. Relaxation in the winds and then get this ball moving. You KNOW you’re in shape to go big at champs
￼

Wednesday 06/26 - 7.26 x6 73.50, 6k x6 78ish
- final session of training camp out in Virginia by myself and I must say I am very pleased with how it went. All 6 throws with the 7.26 were over 70, and last three all in 73 territory
- The number one thing that begins and ends all throws is BENT LEGS. Establish this from the warm ups.
- The second key is RELAXATION of the shoulders all the way through the throw. This MUST also be established from warm up.
- The third key to unlock the LEVEL entry and thus the best acceleration and connection is STRIKING OUT AWAY FROM YOU ON THE ENTRY. Set up a LONG ENTRY THAT IS FAR AWAY FROM YOU OFF THE RIGHT FOOT, then you can simply just stay relaxed and turn out on bent legs
- These three keys are ALL you need. Go into British champs focused on these 3 things, and nothing else. Before each throw, power breath and remind yourself that YOU ARE IN CONTROL. Best of luck

Friday 06/28 - 7.26 x20 pre meet
- had more pre meet throws because I’m throwing 2 days out instead of day before (speed lift day before and then I’m ready)
- Honestly the throws today were quite disappointing in terms of distance , but I literally just travelled back yesterday so of course I’ve needed a day to shake some rust off, and that is exactly what today was. No more, no less. 
- THE MOVEMENT IS 100% THERE. Remember Auburn. You don’t need distance in pre meet for big throws you need feeling in pre meet for big throws. The movement and the feeling is 100% there. You’re ready to throw far

Meet 10 06/30 : 74.80m
- All I’ll say about this is that it’s taking me long to get confident/consistent and believing in the new entry that I worked on with Amo during camp. Unfortunate that I couldn’t put it together in this meet. But when you make big technical changes like that, of course the next thing you have to see is if it will hold up in competition - this did not
- I also want to start hitting my finish. Like I really want to start doing that. Pulling off the finish is taking away east metres that I can have
