## Hammer Throw Training Data Analyzer
This project is a comprehensive Python tool designed to analyze and visualize a hammer throw athlete's training data over an entire year. As a hammer throw athlete myself, I built this tool to derive insights from my own training logs, which I meticulously maintained but struggled to interpret due to the season's inconsistency. The goal was to identify the key technical cues that could help improve the consistency and overall performance in future seasons.

## Features

# 1. Data Ingestion and Processing
The tool reads and processes a text file containing over 1000 lines of training log entries. Each entry includes details about the training sessions, the implements used, and the athlete's subjective feelings about each session.
Custom parsing functions handle variations in data entry formats, converting them into structured data that the tool can analyze.

# 2. Visualizations
Training Volume by Week: Visualizes the total volume of training (in terms of reps) per week, with special markers for meet days, helping to identify periods of peak or inconsistent training.
Distance Progression Over Time: Tracks the athlete's throw distances for specific weights over time, offering insights into performance trends and the effectiveness of training cycles.
Personal Bests: Displays a bar chart of personal best distances for different weights, allowing for quick comparison and identification of strengths and areas for improvement.

# 3. NLP-Driven AI Summary
Leveraging pre-built NLP models, the tool generates an AI-driven summary of the year's training data. This summary provides a list of key technical cues that the athlete should focus on in the next season to enhance performance consistency and break through performance plateaus.
The tool's AI component was particularly valuable for distilling vast amounts of data into actionable insights, making it easier to set focused goals for the upcoming season.

# 4. Personal Motivation
This project stemmed from my own need to make sense of an inconsistent training season. By applying data analysis and machine learning techniques, I was able to derive meaningful conclusions from my training logs, which would have been challenging to achieve manually.

# Getting Started
To use this tool, simply upload your training log file, and the tool will process the data to generate visualizations and a comprehensive AI-driven summary. The outputs are designed to provide clear, actionable insights that can inform your training strategy for the next season.
