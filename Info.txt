Concept: 
There are so many different facets of training to keep track of.
What if you had an app that kept track of statistics and percentage breakdowns of
the work you have put in, to ensure that youâ€™re not missing out on any key portion
of your sport or neglecting something you should be working on

Plan:
1. Breakdown any proportion of my training above and below 16lbs
2. Track total number of throws I am taking per week
3. Track trends in distances with different balls and how they relate to comp performance
